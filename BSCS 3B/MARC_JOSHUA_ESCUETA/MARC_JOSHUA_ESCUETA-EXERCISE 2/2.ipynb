      "117. JACK SPARROW: You know, these clothes do not flatter you at all. It should be a dress or nothing. I happen to have no dress in my cabin.\n",
      "118. JACK SPARROW: Darling, I am truly unhappy to have to tell you this but... through an unfortunate and *entirely* unforeseeable series of circumstances that have nothing whatsoever to do with me, poor William has been press-ganged into Davy Jones' crew.\n",

      "127. JACK SPARROW: True enough. This Compass does not point north.\n",
      "128. JACK SPARROW: It points to the thing you want most in this world.\n",
      "129. JACK SPARROW: Every word, love. And what you want most in this world is to find the chest of Davy Jones, is it not?\n",
      "130. JACK SPARROW: By finding the chest of Davy Jones.\n",
      "131. JACK SPARROW: Mister Gibbs!\n",

      "139. JACK SPARROW: Friendly?\n",
      "140. JACK SPARROW: Will strikes a deal for these and upholds it with honor. Yet you're the one standing here with the prize. Full pardon, commission as a privateer on behalf of England and the East India Trading Company. As if I could be bought for such a low price.\n",
      "141. JACK SPARROW: No. Persuade me.\n",
      "142. JACK SPARROW: As I said... Persuade me.\n",
      "143. JACK SPARROW: My tremendous intuitive sense of the female creature informs me that you are troubled.\n",
      "144. JACK SPARROW: You know... Lizzy... I *am*... captain of a ship. And *being* captain of a ship, I could in fact perform a... marriage. Right here. Right on this deck. Right... *now*!\n",
      "145. JACK SPARROW: Why not? We *are* very much alike, you and I. I and you. Us.\n",
      "146. JACK SPARROW: Trifles. You *will* come over to my side, I know it.\n",
      "147. JACK SPARROW: One word love: curiosity. You long for freedom. You long to do what you want to do because you want it. To act on selfish impulse. You want to see what it's like. One day, you won't be able to resist.\n",
      "148. JACK SPARROW: Uh my Compass works fine.\n",
      "149. JACK SPARROW: I *love* those moments. I like to wave at them as they pass by.\n",

      "166. JACK SPARROW: I knew you'd warm up to me eventually.\n",
      "167. JACK SPARROW: Ah. The dark side of ambition.\n",
      "168. JACK SPARROW: Let us examine that claim for a moment, former Commodore, shall we? Who was it, who at the very moment you had a notorious pirate safely behind bars, saw fit to *free* said pirate, and take your dearly beloved all to hisself, hey? So who's fault is it, *really*, that you've ended up a rum-pot deckhand what takes orders from pirates?\n",
