      "JACK SPARROW: A chest of unknown size and origin.\n",
      "JACK SPARROW: And whoever possesses that chest possesses the leverage to command Jones to do whatever it is he or she wants, including... saving brave William from his grim fate.\n",
      "JACK SPARROW: With this. My Compass... is unique.\n",
      "JACK SPARROW: True enough. This Compass does not point north.\n",
      "JACK SPARROW: It points to the thing you want most in this world.\n",
      "JACK SPARROW: Every word, love. And what you want most in this world is to find the chest of Davy Jones, is it not?\n",
      "JACK SPARROW: By finding the chest of Davy Jones.\n",
      "JACK SPARROW: Mister Gibbs!\n",
      "JACK SPARROW: We have our heading.\n",
      "JACK SPARROW: Miss Swann.\n",
      "JACK SPARROW: Agh.\n",
      "JACK SPARROW: Agh.\n",
      "JACK SPARROW: Of course. He wants the chest.\n",
      "JACK SPARROW: A truly discomforting notion, love.\n",
      "JACK SPARROW: Might I inquire how as to how you came by these? \n",
      "JACK SPARROW: Friendly?\n",
      "JACK SPARROW: Will strikes a deal for these and upholds it with honor. Yet you're the one standing here with the prize. Full pardon, commission as a privateer on behalf of England and the East India Trading Company. As if I could be bought for such a low price. \n",
      "JACK SPARROW: No. Persuade me.\n",
      "JACK SPARROW: As I said... Persuade me.\n",
      "JACK SPARROW: My tremendous intuitive sense of the female creature informs me that you are troubled.\n",
      "JACK SPARROW: You know... Lizzy... I *am*... captain of a ship. And *being* captain of a ship, I could in fact perform a... marriage. Right here. Right on this deck. Right... *now*! \n",
      "JACK SPARROW: Why not? We *are* very much alike, you and I. I and you. Us.\n",
      "JACK SPARROW: Trifles. You *will* come over to my side, I know it.\n",
      "JACK SPARROW: One word love: curiosity. You long for freedom. You long to do what you want to do because you want it. To act on selfish impulse. You want to see what it's like. One day, you won't be able to resist.\n",
      "JACK SPARROW: Uh my Compass works fine. \n",
      "JACK SPARROW: I *love* those moments. I like to wave at them as they pass by.\n",
      "JACK SPARROW: All evidence to the contrary.\n",
      "JACK SPARROW: Do tell, dearie.\n",
      "JACK SPARROW: I *do* want to know what it tastes like.\n",
      "JACK SPARROW: I want my jar of dirt. \n",
      "JACK SPARROW: Guard the boat, mind the tide... Don't touch my dirt.\n",
      "JACK SPARROW: Yes it *does*. You're sitting on it! \n",
      "JACK SPARROW: Move. \n",
      "JACK SPARROW: I do that quite a lot. Yet people are always surprised.\n",
      "JACK SPARROW: How did you get here?\n",
      "JACK SPARROW: Not so easy, is it?\n",
      "JACK SPARROW: You do?\n",
      "JACK SPARROW: What?\n",
      "JACK SPARROW: Oh! Well... you're welcome, then.\n",
      "JACK SPARROW: Pretty much. Time and tide, love. \n",
      "JACK SPARROW: Oy! What're you doing?\n",
      "JACK SPARROW: Can't let you do that, William. 'Cause if Jones is dead, who's to call his terrible beastie off the hunt, eh? Now. If you please: The key.\n",
      "JACK SPARROW: I knew you'd warm up to me eventually.\n",
      "JACK SPARROW: Ah. The dark side of ambition.\n",
      "JACK SPARROW: Let us examine that claim for a moment, former Commodore, shall we? Who was it, who at the very moment you had a notorious pirate safely behind bars, saw fit to *free* said pirate, and take your dearly beloved all to hisself, hey? So who's fault is it, *really*, that you've ended up a rum-pot deckhand what takes orders from pirates?\n",
      "JACK SPARROW: Still rooting for you, mate!\n",
      "JACK SPARROW: Wup!\n",
      "JACK SPARROW: Oh.\n",
      "JACK SPARROW: Woah!\n",
      "JACK SPARROW: Oh, shut it.\n",
      "JACK SPARROW: Jar of dirt!\n",
      "JACK SPARROW: Leave him lie! Unless you plan on using him to hit something with.\n",
      "JACK SPARROW: Uh, I say we respect his final wish.\n",
      "JACK SPARROW: He fell behind.\n",
      "JACK SPARROW: I'll handle this, mate.\n",
      "JACK SPARROW: Hey! Fishface! Lose something? Hey? Oup!\n",
      "JACK SPARROW: Got it! \n",
      "JACK SPARROW: Come to negotiate, eh, have you, you slimy git? Look what I got. I got a jar of dirt! I got a jar of dirt! And guess what's inside it?\n",
      "JACK SPARROW: Hard to starboard.\n",
      "JACK SPARROW: Why fight when you can negotiate? All one needs... is the proper leverage.\n",
      "JACK SPARROW: Where is it? Where is the thump-thump? We must've hit the reef! \n",
      "JACK SPARROW: Abandon ship. Into the longboat.\n",
      "JACK SPARROW: She's only a ship, mate.\n",
      "JACK SPARROW: We're not free yet, love.\n",
      "JACK SPARROW: Pirate. \n",
      "JACK SPARROW: Bugger, bugger, bugger, bugger, bugger, bugger...!\n",
      "JACK SPARROW: Come on... Come on...\n",
      "JACK SPARROW: Not so bad.\n",
      "JACK SPARROW: Oh!\n",
      "JACK SPARROW: Hello, beastie.\n"
