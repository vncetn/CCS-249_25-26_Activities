      "\n",
      "It was a queer sort of place—a gable-ended old house, one side palsied\n",

      "where that tempestuous wind Euroclydon kept up a worse howling than\n",

      "outside, or whether thou observest it from that sashless window, where\n",
      "the frost is on both sides, and of which the wight Death is the only\n",
      "glazier.” True enough, thought I, as this passage occurred to my\n",

      "here and there. But it’s too late to make any improvements now. The\n",
      "universe is finished; the copestone is on, and the chips were carted\n",
      "off a million years ago. Poor Lazarus there, chattering his teeth\n",
      "against the curbstone for his pillow, and shaking off his tatters with\n",
      "his shiverings, he might plug up both ears with rags, and put a\n",
      "corn-cob into his mouth, and yet that would not keep out the\n",
      "tempestuous Euroclydon. Euroclydon! says old Dives, in his red silken\n",
      "wrapper—(he had a redder one afterwards) pooh, pooh! What a fine frosty\n",
      "night; how Orion glitters; what northern lights! Let them talk of their\n",
      "oriental summer climes of everlasting conservatories; give me the\n",
      "privilege of making my own summer with my own coals.\n",

      "But what thinks Lazarus? Can he warm his blue hands by holding them up\n",

      "\n",
      "Entering that gable-ended Spouter-Inn, you found yourself in a wide,\n",
      "low, straggling entry with old-fashioned wainscots, reminding one of\n",
      "the bulwarks of some condemned old craft. On one side hung a very large\n",
      "oilpainting so thoroughly besmoked, and every way defaced, that in the\n",
      "unequal crosslights by which you viewed it, it was only by diligent\n",
      "study and a series of systematic visits to it, and careful inquiry of\n",
      "the neighbors, that you could any way arrive at an understanding of its\n",
      "purpose. Such unaccountable masses of shades and shadows, that at first\n",
      "you almost thought some ambitious young artist, in the time of the New\n",
      "England hags, had endeavored to delineate chaos bewitched. But by dint\n",
      "of much and earnest contemplation, and oft repeated ponderings, and\n",
      "especially by throwing open the little window towards the back of the\n",
      "entry, you at last come to the conclusion that such an idea, however\n",
      "wild, might not be altogether unwarranted.\n",
      "\n",
      "But what most puzzled and confounded you was a long, limber,\n",
      "portentous, black mass of something hovering in the centre of the\n",
      "picture over three blue, dim, perpendicular lines floating in a\n",
      "nameless yeast. A boggy, soggy, squitchy picture truly, enough to drive\n",
      "a nervous man distracted. Yet was there a sort of indefinite,\n",
      "half-attained, unimaginable sublimity about it that fairly froze you to\n",
      "it, till you involuntarily took an oath with yourself to find out what\n",
      "that marvellous painting meant. Ever and anon a bright, but, alas,\n",
      "deceptive idea would dart you through.—It’s the Black Sea in a midnight\n",
      "gale.—It’s the unnatural combat of the four primal elements.—It’s a\n",
      "blasted heath.—It’s a Hyperborean winter scene.—It’s the breaking-up of\n",
      "the icebound stream of Time. But at last all these fancies yielded to\n",
      "that one portentous something in the picture’s midst. _That_ once found\n",
      "out, and all the rest were plain. But stop; does it not bear a faint\n",
      "resemblance to a gigantic fish? even the great leviathan himself?\n",
      "\n",
      "In fact, the artist’s design seemed this: a final theory of my own,\n",
      "partly based upon the aggregated opinions of many aged persons with\n",
      "whom I conversed upon the subject. The picture represents a Cape-Horner\n",
      "in a great hurricane; the half-foundered ship weltering there with its\n",
      "three dismantled masts alone visible; and an exasperated whale,\n",
      "purposing to spring clean over the craft, is in the enormous act of\n",
      "impaling himself upon the three mast-heads.\n",
      "\n",
      "The opposite wall of this entry was hung all over with a heathenish\n",
      "array of monstrous clubs and spears. Some were thickly set with\n",
      "glittering teeth resembling ivory saws; others were tufted with knots\n",
      "of human hair; and one was sickle-shaped, with a vast handle sweeping\n",
      "round like the segment made in the new-mown grass by a long-armed\n",
      "mower. You shuddered as you gazed, and wondered what monstrous cannibal\n",
      "and savage could ever have gone a death-harvesting with such a hacking,\n",
      "horrifying implement. Mixed with these were rusty old whaling lances\n",
      "and harpoons all broken and deformed. Some were storied weapons. With\n",
      "this once long lance, now wildly elbowed, fifty years ago did Nathan\n",
      "Swain kill fifteen whales between a sunrise and a sunset. And that\n",
      "harpoon—so like a corkscrew now—was flung in Javan seas, and run away\n",
      "with by a whale, years afterwards slain off the Cape of Blanco. The\n",
      "original iron entered nigh the tail, and, like a restless needle\n",
      "sojourning in the body of a man, travelled full forty feet, and at last\n",

      "decanters, bottles, flasks; and in those jaws of swift destruction,\n",
      "like another cursed Jonah (by which name indeed they called him),\n",

      "his jack-knife, stooping over and diligently working away at the space\n",

      "he couldn’t afford it. Nothing but two dismal tallow candles, each in a\n",
      "winding sheet. We were fain to button up our monkey jackets, and hold\n",
      "to our lips cups of scalding tea with our half frozen fingers. But the\n",
      "fare was of the most substantial kind—not only meat and potatoes, but\n",
      "dumplings; good heavens! dumplings for supper! One young fellow in a\n",

      "I observed, however, that one of them held somewhat aloof, and though\n",
      "he seemed desirous not to spoil the hilarity of his shipmates by his\n",
      "own sober face, yet upon the whole he refrained from making as much\n",
      "noise as the rest. This man interested me at once; and since the\n",
      "sea-gods had ordained that he should soon become my shipmate (though\n",
      "but a sleeping-partner one, so far as this narrative is concerned), I\n",
      "will here venture upon a little description of him. He stood full six\n",
      "feet in height, with noble shoulders, and a chest like a coffer-dam. I\n",
      "have seldom seen such brawn in a man. His face was deeply brown and\n",
      "burnt, making his white teeth dazzling by the contrast; while in the\n",
      "deep shadows of his eyes floated some reminiscences that did not seem\n",
      "to give him much joy. His voice at once announced that he was a\n",
      "Southerner, and from his fine stature, I thought he must be one of\n",
      "those tall mountaineers from the Alleghanian Ridge in Virginia. When\n",
      "the revelry of his companions had mounted to its height, this man\n",
      "slipped away unobserved, and I saw no more of him till he became my\n",
      "comrade on the sea. In a few minutes, however, he was missed by his\n",
      "shipmates, and being, it seems, for some reason a huge favourite with\n",
      "them, they raised a cry of “Bulkington! Bulkington! where’s\n",
      "Bulkington?” and darted out of the house in pursuit of him.\n",

      "It was now about nine o’clock, and the room seeming almost\n",
      "supernaturally quiet after these orgies, I began to congratulate myself\n",

      "rather not sleep with your own brother. I don’t know how it is, but\n",
      "people like to be private when they are sleeping. And when it comes to\n",
      "sleeping with an unknown stranger, in a strange inn, in a strange town,\n",
      "and that stranger a harpooneer, then your objections indefinitely\n",
      "multiply. Nor was there any earthly reason why I as a sailor should\n",
      "sleep two in a bed, more than anybody else; for sailors no more sleep\n",
      "two in a bed at sea, than bachelor Kings do ashore. To be sure they all\n",
      "sleep together in one apartment, but you have your own hammock, and\n",
      "cover yourself with your own blanket, and sleep in your own skin.\n",
      "\n",
      "The more I pondered over this harpooneer, the more I abominated the\n",
      "thought of sleeping with him. It was fair to presume that being a\n",
      "harpooneer, his linen or woollen, as the case might be, would not be of\n",
      "the tidiest, certainly none of the finest. I began to twitch all over.\n",
      "Besides, it was getting late, and my decent harpooneer ought to be home\n",
      "and going bedwards. Suppose now, he should tumble in upon me at\n",
      "midnight—how could I tell from what vile hole he had been coming?\n",
      "\n",
      "“Landlord! I’ve changed my mind about that harpooneer.—I shan’t sleep\n",
      "with him. I’ll try the bench here.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Just as you please; I’m sorry I can’t spare ye a tablecloth for a\n",
      "mattress, and it’s a plaguy rough board here”—feeling of the knots and\n",
      "notches. “But wait a bit, Skrimshander; I’ve got a carpenter’s plane\n",
      "there in the bar—wait, I say, and I’ll make ye snug enough.” So saying\n",
      "he procured the plane; and with his old silk handkerchief first dusting\n",
      "the bench, vigorously set to planing away at my bed, the while grinning\n",
      "like an ape. The shavings flew right and left; till at last the\n",
      "plane-iron came bump against an indestructible knot. The landlord was\n",
      "near spraining his wrist, and I told him for heaven’s sake to quit—the\n",
      "bed was soft enough to suit me, and I did not know how all the planing\n",
      "in the world could make eider down of a pine plank. So gathering up the\n",
      "shavings with another grin, and throwing them into the great stove in\n",
      "the middle of the room, he went about his business, and left me in a\n",
      "brown study.\n",
      "\n",
      "I now took the measure of the bench, and found that it was a foot too\n",
      "short; but that could be mended with a chair. But it was a foot too\n",
      "narrow, and the other bench in the room was about four inches higher\n",
      "than the planed one—so there was no yoking them. I then placed the\n",
      "first bench lengthwise along the only clear space against the wall,\n",
      "leaving a little interval between, for my back to settle down in. But I\n",
      "soon found that there came such a draught of cold air over me from\n",
      "under the sill of the window, that this plan would never do at all,\n",
      "especially as another current from the rickety door met the one from\n",
      "the window, and both together formed a series of small whirlwinds in\n",
      "the immediate vicinity of the spot where I had thought to spend the\n",
      "night.\n",
      "\n",
      "The devil fetch that harpooneer, thought I, but stop, couldn’t I steal\n",
      "a march on him—bolt his door inside, and jump into his bed, not to be\n",
      "wakened by the most violent knockings? It seemed no bad idea; but upon\n",
      "second thoughts I dismissed it. For who could tell but what the next\n",
      "morning, so soon as I popped out of the room, the harpooneer might be\n",
      "standing in the entry, all ready to knock me down!\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, looking round me again, and seeing no possible chance of\n",
      "spending a sufferable night unless in some other person’s bed, I began\n",
      "to think that after all I might be cherishing unwarrantable prejudices\n",
      "against this unknown harpooneer. Thinks I, I’ll wait awhile; he must be\n",
      "dropping in before long. I’ll have a good look at him then, and perhaps\n",
      "we may become jolly good bedfellows after all—there’s no telling.\n",
      "\n",
      "But though the other boarders kept coming in by ones, twos, and threes,\n",

      "“Landlord!” said I, “what sort of a chap is he—does he always keep such\n",
      "late hours?” It was now hard upon twelve o’clock.\n",
      "\n",
      "The landlord chuckled again with his lean chuckle, and seemed to be\n",
      "mightily tickled at something beyond my comprehension. “No,” he\n",
      "answered, “generally he’s an early bird—airley to bed and airley to\n",
      "rise—yes, he’s the bird what catches the worm. But to-night he went out\n",
      "a peddling, you see, and I don’t see what on airth keeps him so late,\n",

      "\n",
      "“Can’t sell his head?—What sort of a bamboozingly story is this you are\n",
      "telling me?” getting into a towering rage. “Do you pretend to say,\n",
      "landlord, that this harpooneer is actually engaged this blessed\n",
      "Saturday night, or rather Sunday morning, in peddling his head around\n",
      "this town?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That’s precisely it,” said the landlord, “and I told him he couldn’t\n",

      "\n",
      "“With what?” shouted I.\n",
      "\n",
      "“With heads to be sure; ain’t there too many heads in the world?”\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "“May be not,” taking out a stick and whittling a toothpick, “but I\n",

      "slanderin’ his head.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’ll break it for him,” said I, now flying into a passion again at\n",

      "“Broke,” said I—“_broke_, do you mean?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Sartain, and that’s the very reason he can’t sell it, I guess.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Landlord,” said I, going up to him as cool as Mt. Hecla in a\n",
      "snow-storm—“landlord, stop whittling. You and I must understand one\n",
      "another, and that too without delay. I come to your house and want a\n",
      "bed; you tell me you can only give me half a one; that the other half\n",
      "belongs to a certain harpooneer. And about this harpooneer, whom I have\n",
      "not yet seen, you persist in telling me the most mystifying and\n",
      "exasperating stories tending to beget in me an uncomfortable feeling\n",
      "towards the man whom you design for my bedfellow—a sort of connexion,\n",
      "landlord, which is an intimate and confidential one in the highest\n",
      "degree. I now demand of you to speak out and tell me who and what this\n",
      "harpooneer is, and whether I shall be in all respects safe to spend the\n",
      "night with him. And in the first place, you will be so good as to unsay\n",
      "that story about selling his head, which if true I take to be good\n",
      "evidence that this harpooneer is stark mad, and I’ve no idea of\n",
      "sleeping with a madman; and you, sir, _you_ I mean, landlord, _you_,\n",
      "sir, by trying to induce me to do so knowingly, would thereby render\n",
      "yourself liable to a criminal prosecution.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wall,” said the landlord, fetching a long breath, “that’s a purty long\n",
      "sarmon for a chap that rips a little now and then. But be easy, be\n",
      "easy, this here harpooneer I have been tellin’ you of has just arrived\n",
      "from the south seas, where he bought up a lot of ’balmed New Zealand\n",
      "heads (great curios, you know), and he’s sold all on ’em but one, and\n",
      "that one he’s trying to sell to-night, cause to-morrow’s Sunday, and it\n",
      "would not do to be sellin’ human heads about the streets when folks is\n",
      "goin’ to churches. He wanted to, last Sunday, but I stopped him just as\n",
      "he was goin’ out of the door with four heads strung on a string, for\n",
      "all the airth like a string of inions.”\n",
      "\n",
      "This account cleared up the otherwise unaccountable mystery, and showed\n",
      "that the landlord, after all, had had no idea of fooling me—but at the\n",
      "same time what could I think of a harpooneer who stayed out of a\n",
      "Saturday night clean into the holy Sabbath, engaged in such a cannibal\n",
      "business as selling the heads of dead idolators?\n",
      "\n",
      "“Depend upon it, landlord, that harpooneer is a dangerous man.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“He pays reg’lar,” was the rejoinder. “But come, it’s getting dreadful\n",
      "late, you had better be turning flukes—it’s a nice bed; Sal and me\n",
      "slept in that ere bed the night we were spliced. There’s plenty of room\n",
      "for two to kick about in that bed; it’s an almighty big bed that. Why,\n",
      "afore we give it up, Sal used to put our Sam and little Johnny in the\n",
      "foot of it. But I got a dreaming and sprawling about one night, and\n",
      "somehow, Sam got pitched on the floor, and came near breaking his arm.\n",
      "Arter that, Sal said it wouldn’t do. Come along here, I’ll give ye a\n",
      "glim in a jiffy;” and so saying he lighted a candle and held it towards\n",
      "me, offering to lead the way. But I stood irresolute; when looking at a\n",
      "clock in the corner, he exclaimed “I vum it’s Sunday—you won’t see that\n",
      "harpooneer to-night; he’s come to anchor somewhere—come along then;\n",
      "_do_ come; _won’t_ ye come?”\n",
      "\n",
      "I considered the matter a moment, and then up stairs we went, and I was\n",
      "ushered into a small room, cold as a clam, and furnished, sure enough,\n",
      "with a prodigious bed, almost big enough indeed for any four\n",
      "harpooneers to sleep abreast.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There,” said the landlord, placing the candle on a crazy old sea chest\n",
      "that did double duty as a wash-stand and centre table; “there, make\n",
      "yourself comfortable now, and good night to ye.” I turned round from\n",
      "eyeing the bed, but he had disappeared.\n",
      "\n",
      "Folding back the counterpane, I stooped over the bed. Though none of\n",
      "the most elegant, it yet stood the scrutiny tolerably well. I then\n",
      "glanced round the room; and besides the bedstead and centre table,\n",
      "could see no other furniture belonging to the place, but a rude shelf,\n",
      "the four walls, and a papered fireboard representing a man striking a\n",
      "whale. Of things not properly belonging to the room, there was a\n",
      "hammock lashed up, and thrown upon the floor in one corner; also a\n",
      "large seaman’s bag, containing the harpooneer’s wardrobe, no doubt in\n",
      "lieu of a land trunk. Likewise, there was a parcel of outlandish bone\n",
      "fish hooks on the shelf over the fire-place, and a tall harpoon\n",
      "standing at the head of the bed.\n",
      "\n",
      "But what is this on the chest? I took it up, and held it close to the\n",
      "light, and felt it, and smelt it, and tried every way possible to\n",
      "arrive at some satisfactory conclusion concerning it. I can compare it\n",
      "to nothing but a large door mat, ornamented at the edges with little\n",
      "tinkling tags something like the stained porcupine quills round an\n",
      "Indian moccasin. There was a hole or slit in the middle of this mat, as\n",
      "you see the same in South American ponchos. But could it be possible\n",
      "that any sober harpooneer would get into a door mat, and parade the\n",
      "streets of any Christian town in that sort of guise? I put it on, to\n",
      "try it, and it weighed me down like a hamper, being uncommonly shaggy\n",
      "and thick, and I thought a little damp, as though this mysterious\n",
      "harpooneer had been wearing it of a rainy day. I went up in it to a bit\n",
      "of glass stuck against the wall, and I never saw such a sight in my\n",
      "life. I tore myself out of it in such a hurry that I gave myself a kink\n",
      "in the neck.\n",
      "\n",
      "I sat down on the side of the bed, and commenced thinking about this\n",
      "head-peddling harpooneer, and his door mat. After thinking some time on\n",
      "the bed-side, I got up and took off my monkey jacket, and then stood in\n",
      "the middle of the room thinking. I then took off my coat, and thought a\n",
      "little more in my shirt sleeves. But beginning to feel very cold now,\n",
      "half undressed as I was, and remembering what the landlord said about\n",
      "the harpooneer’s not coming home at all that night, it being so very\n",
      "late, I made no more ado, but jumped out of my pantaloons and boots,\n",
      "and then blowing out the light tumbled into bed, and commended myself\n",
      "to the care of heaven.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whether that mattress was stuffed with corn-cobs or broken crockery,\n",
      "there is no telling, but I rolled about a good deal, and could not\n",
      "sleep for a long time. At last I slid off into a light doze, and had\n",
      "pretty nearly made a good offing towards the land of Nod, when I heard\n",
      "a heavy footfall in the passage, and saw a glimmer of light come into\n",
      "the room from under the door.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lord save me, thinks I, that must be the harpooneer, the infernal\n",
      "head-peddler. But I lay perfectly still, and resolved not to say a word\n",
      "till spoken to. Holding a light in one hand, and that identical New\n",
      "Zealand head in the other, the stranger entered the room, and without\n",
      "looking towards the bed, placed his candle a good way off from me on\n",
      "the floor in one corner, and then began working away at the knotted\n",
      "cords of the large bag I before spoke of as being in the room. I was\n",
      "all eagerness to see his face, but he kept it averted for some time\n",
      "while employed in unlacing the bag’s mouth. This accomplished, however,\n",
      "he turned round—when, good heavens! what a sight! Such a face! It was\n",
      "of a dark, purplish, yellow colour, here and there stuck over with\n",
      "large blackish looking squares. Yes, it’s just as I thought, he’s a\n",
      "terrible bedfellow; he’s been in a fight, got dreadfully cut, and here\n",
      "he is, just from the surgeon. But at that moment he chanced to turn his\n",
      "face so towards the light, that I plainly saw they could not be\n",
      "sticking-plasters at all, those black squares on his cheeks. They were\n",
      "stains of some sort or other. At first I knew not what to make of this;\n",
      "but soon an inkling of the truth occurred to me. I remembered a story\n",
      "of a white man—a whaleman too—who, falling among the cannibals, had\n",
      "been tattooed by them. I concluded that this harpooneer, in the course\n",
      "of his distant voyages, must have met with a similar adventure. And\n",
      "what is it, thought I, after all! It’s only his outside; a man can be\n",
      "honest in any sort of skin. But then, what to make of his unearthly\n",
      "complexion, that part of it, I mean, lying round about, and completely\n",
      "independent of the squares of tattooing. To be sure, it might be\n",
      "nothing but a good coat of tropical tanning; but I never heard of a hot\n",
      "sun’s tanning a white man into a purplish yellow one. However, I had\n",
      "never been in the South Seas; and perhaps the sun there produced these\n",
      "extraordinary effects upon the skin. Now, while all these ideas were\n",
      "passing through me like lightning, this harpooneer never noticed me at\n",
      "all. But, after some difficulty having opened his bag, he commenced\n",
      "fumbling in it, and presently pulled out a sort of tomahawk, and a\n",
      "seal-skin wallet with the hair on. Placing these on the old chest in\n",
      "the middle of the room, he then took the New Zealand head—a ghastly\n",
      "thing enough—and crammed it down into the bag. He now took off his\n",
      "hat—a new beaver hat—when I came nigh singing out with fresh surprise.\n",
      "There was no hair on his head—none to speak of at least—nothing but a\n",
      "small scalp-knot twisted up on his forehead. His bald purplish head now\n",
      "looked for all the world like a mildewed skull. Had not the stranger\n",
      "stood between me and the door, I would have bolted out of it quicker\n",
      "than ever I bolted a dinner.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even as it was, I thought something of slipping out of the window, but\n",
      "it was the second floor back. I am no coward, but what to make of this\n",
      "head-peddling purple rascal altogether passed my comprehension.\n",
      "Ignorance is the parent of fear, and being completely nonplussed and\n",
      "confounded about the stranger, I confess I was now as much afraid of\n",
      "him as if it was the devil himself who had thus broken into my room at\n",
      "the dead of night. In fact, I was so afraid of him that I was not game\n",
      "enough just then to address him, and demand a satisfactory answer\n",
      "concerning what seemed inexplicable in him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, he continued the business of undressing, and at last showed\n",
      "his chest and arms. As I live, these covered parts of him were\n",
      "checkered with the same squares as his face; his back, too, was all\n",
      "over the same dark squares; he seemed to have been in a Thirty Years’\n",
      "War, and just escaped from it with a sticking-plaster shirt. Still\n",
      "more, his very legs were marked, as if a parcel of dark green frogs\n",
      "were running up the trunks of young palms. It was now quite plain that\n",
      "he must be some abominable savage or other shipped aboard of a whaleman\n",
      "in the South Seas, and so landed in this Christian country. I quaked to\n",
      "think of it. A peddler of heads too—perhaps the heads of his own\n",
      "brothers. He might take a fancy to mine—heavens! look at that tomahawk!\n",
      "\n",
      "But there was no time for shuddering, for now the savage went about\n",
      "something that completely fascinated my attention, and convinced me\n",
      "that he must indeed be a heathen. Going to his heavy grego, or wrapall,\n",
      "or dreadnaught, which he had previously hung on a chair, he fumbled in\n",
      "the pockets, and produced at length a curious little deformed image\n",
      "with a hunch on its back, and exactly the colour of a three days’ old\n",
      "Congo baby. Remembering the embalmed head, at first I almost thought\n",
      "that this black manikin was a real baby preserved in some similar\n",
      "manner. But seeing that it was not at all limber, and that it glistened\n",
      "a good deal like polished ebony, I concluded that it must be nothing\n",
      "but a wooden idol, which indeed it proved to be. For now the savage\n",
      "goes up to the empty fire-place, and removing the papered fire-board,\n",
      "sets up this little hunch-backed image, like a tenpin, between the\n",
      "andirons. The chimney jambs and all the bricks inside were very sooty,\n",
      "so that I thought this fire-place made a very appropriate little shrine\n",
      "or chapel for his Congo idol.\n",
      "\n",
      "I now screwed my eyes hard towards the half hidden image, feeling but\n",
      "ill at ease meantime—to see what was next to follow. First he takes\n",
      "about a double handful of shavings out of his grego pocket, and places\n",
      "them carefully before the idol; then laying a bit of ship biscuit on\n",
      "top and applying the flame from the lamp, he kindled the shavings into\n",
      "a sacrificial blaze. Presently, after many hasty snatches into the\n",
      "fire, and still hastier withdrawals of his fingers (whereby he seemed\n",

      "as carelessly as if he were a sportsman bagging a dead woodcock.\n",

      "I had so long been bound.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the interval I spent in deliberating what to say, was a fatal one.\n",

      "an instant, and then holding it to the light, with his mouth at the\n",
      "handle, he puffed out great clouds of tobacco smoke. The next moment\n",
      "the light was extinguished, and this wild cannibal, tomahawk between\n",
      "his teeth, sprang into bed with me. I sang out, I could not help it\n",

      "civil but a really kind and charitable way. I stood looking at him a\n",
      "moment. For all his tattooings he was on the whole a clean, comely\n",
      "looking cannibal. What’s all this fuss I have been making about,\n",
      "thought I to myself—the man’s a human being just as I am: he has just\n",

      "\n",
      "Upon waking next morning about daylight, I found Queequeg’s arm thrown\n",
      "over me in the most loving and affectionate manner. You had almost\n",
      "thought I had been his wife. The counterpane was of patchwork, full of\n",
      "odd little parti-coloured squares and triangles; and this arm of his\n",
      "tattooed all over with an interminable Cretan labyrinth of a figure, no\n",
      "two parts of which were of one precise shade—owing I suppose to his\n",
      "keeping his arm at sea unmethodically in sun and shade, his shirt\n",
      "sleeves irregularly rolled up at various times—this same arm of his, I\n",
      "say, looked for all the world like a strip of that same patchwork\n",
      "quilt. Indeed, partly lying on it as the arm did when I first awoke, I\n",
      "could hardly tell it from the quilt, they so blended their hues\n",
      "together; and it was only by the sense of weight and pressure that I\n",
      "could tell that Queequeg was hugging me.\n",
      "\n",
      "My sensations were strange. Let me try to explain them. When I was a\n",
      "child, I well remember a somewhat similar circumstance that befell me;\n",
      "whether it was a reality or a dream, I never could entirely settle. The\n",
      "circumstance was this. I had been cutting up some caper or other—I\n",
      "think it was trying to crawl up the chimney, as I had seen a little\n",
      "sweep do a few days previous; and my stepmother who, somehow or other,\n",
      "was all the time whipping me, or sending me to bed supperless,—my\n",
      "mother dragged me by the legs out of the chimney and packed me off to\n",
      "bed, though it was only two o’clock in the afternoon of the 21st June,\n",
      "the longest day in the year in our hemisphere. I felt dreadfully. But\n",
      "there was no help for it, so up stairs I went to my little room in the\n",
      "third floor, undressed myself as slowly as possible so as to kill time,\n",
      "and with a bitter sigh got between the sheets.\n",
      "\n",
      "I lay there dismally calculating that sixteen entire hours must elapse\n",
      "before I could hope for a resurrection. Sixteen hours in bed! the small\n",
      "of my back ached to think of it. And it was so light too; the sun\n",
      "shining in at the window, and a great rattling of coaches in the\n",
      "streets, and the sound of gay voices all over the house. I felt worse\n",
      "and worse—at last I got up, dressed, and softly going down in my\n",
      "stockinged feet, sought out my stepmother, and suddenly threw myself at\n",
      "her feet, beseeching her as a particular favour to give me a good\n",
      "slippering for my misbehaviour; anything indeed but condemning me to\n",
      "lie abed such an unendurable length of time. But she was the best and\n",
      "most conscientious of stepmothers, and back I had to go to my room. For\n",
      "several hours I lay there broad awake, feeling a great deal worse than\n",
      "I have ever done since, even from the greatest subsequent misfortunes.\n",
      "At last I must have fallen into a troubled nightmare of a doze; and\n",
      "slowly waking from it—half steeped in dreams—I opened my eyes, and the\n",
      "before sun-lit room was now wrapped in outer darkness. Instantly I felt\n",
      "a shock running through all my frame; nothing was to be seen, and\n",
      "nothing was to be heard; but a supernatural hand seemed placed in mine.\n",
      "My arm hung over the counterpane, and the nameless, unimaginable,\n",
      "silent form or phantom, to which the hand belonged, seemed closely\n",
      "seated by my bed-side. For what seemed ages piled on ages, I lay there,\n",
      "frozen with the most awful fears, not daring to drag away my hand; yet\n",
      "ever thinking that if I could but stir it one single inch, the horrid\n",
      "spell would be broken. I knew not how this consciousness at last glided\n",
      "away from me; but waking in the morning, I shudderingly remembered it\n",
      "all, and for days and weeks and months afterwards I lost myself in\n",
      "confounding attempts to explain the mystery. Nay, to this very hour, I\n",
      "often puzzle myself with it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, take away the awful fear, and my sensations at feeling the\n",
      "supernatural hand in mine were very similar, in their strangeness, to\n",
      "those which I experienced on waking up and seeing Queequeg’s pagan arm\n",
      "thrown round me. But at length all the past night’s events soberly\n",
      "recurred, one by one, in fixed reality, and then I lay only alive to\n",
      "the comical predicament. For though I tried to move his arm—unlock his\n",
      "bridegroom clasp—yet, sleeping as he was, he still hugged me tightly,\n",
      "as though naught but death should part us twain. I now strove to rouse\n",
      "him—“Queequeg!”—but his only answer was a snore. I then rolled over, my\n",
      "neck feeling as if it were in a horse-collar; and suddenly felt a\n",
      "slight scratch. Throwing aside the counterpane, there lay the tomahawk\n",
      "sleeping by the savage’s side, as if it were a hatchet-faced baby. A\n",
      "pretty pickle, truly, thought I; abed here in a strange house in the\n",
      "broad day, with a cannibal and a tomahawk! “Queequeg!—in the name of\n",
      "goodness, Queequeg, wake!” At length, by dint of much wriggling, and\n",
      "loud and incessant expostulations upon the unbecomingness of his\n",
      "hugging a fellow male in that matrimonial sort of style, I succeeded in\n",
      "extracting a grunt; and presently, he drew back his arm, shook himself\n",
      "all over like a Newfoundland dog just from the water, and sat up in\n",
      "bed, stiff as a pike-staff, looking at me, and rubbing his eyes as if\n",
      "he did not altogether remember how I came to be there, though a dim\n",
      "consciousness of knowing something about me seemed slowly dawning over\n",
      "him. Meanwhile, I lay quietly eyeing him, having no serious misgivings\n",
      "now, and bent upon narrowly observing so curious a creature. When, at\n",
      "last, his mind seemed made up touching the character of his bedfellow,\n",
      "and he became, as it were, reconciled to the fact; he jumped out upon\n",
      "the floor, and by certain signs and sounds gave me to understand that,\n",
      "if it pleased me, he would dress first and then leave me to dress\n",
      "afterwards, leaving the whole apartment to myself. Thinks I, Queequeg,\n",
      "under the circumstances, this is a very civilized overture; but, the\n",
      "truth is, these savages have an innate sense of delicacy, say what you\n",
      "will; it is marvellous how essentially polite they are. I pay this\n",
      "particular compliment to Queequeg, because he treated me with so much\n",
      "civility and consideration, while I was guilty of great rudeness;\n",
      "staring at him from the bed, and watching all his toilette motions; for\n",
      "the time my curiosity getting the better of my breeding. Nevertheless,\n",
      "a man like Queequeg you don’t see every day, he and his ways were well\n",
      "worth unusual regarding.\n",
      "\n",
      "He commenced dressing at top by donning his beaver hat, a very tall\n",
      "one, by the by, and then—still minus his trowsers—he hunted up his\n",
      "boots. What under the heavens he did it for, I cannot tell, but his\n",
      "next movement was to crush himself—boots in hand, and hat on—under the\n",
      "bed; when, from sundry violent gaspings and strainings, I inferred he\n",
      "was hard at work booting himself; though by no law of propriety that I\n",
      "ever heard of, is any man required to be private when putting on his\n",
      "boots. But Queequeg, do you see, was a creature in the transition\n",
      "stage—neither caterpillar nor butterfly. He was just enough civilized\n",
      "to show off his outlandishness in the strangest possible manners. His\n",
      "education was not yet completed. He was an undergraduate. If he had not\n",
      "been a small degree civilized, he very probably would not have troubled\n",
      "himself with boots at all; but then, if he had not been still a savage,\n",
      "he never would have dreamt of getting under the bed to put them on. At\n",
      "last, he emerged with his hat very much dented and crushed down over\n",
      "his eyes, and began creaking and limping about the room, as if, not\n",
      "being much accustomed to boots, his pair of damp, wrinkled cowhide\n",
      "ones—probably not made to order either—rather pinched and tormented him\n",
      "at the first go off of a bitter cold morning.\n",
      "\n",
      "Seeing, now, that there were no curtains to the window, and that the\n",
      "street being very narrow, the house opposite commanded a plain view\n",
      "into the room, and observing more and more the indecorous figure that\n",
      "Queequeg made, staving about with little else but his hat and boots on;\n",
      "I begged him as well as I could, to accelerate his toilet somewhat, and\n",
      "particularly to get into his pantaloons as soon as possible. He\n",
      "complied, and then proceeded to wash himself. At that time in the\n",
      "morning any Christian would have washed his face; but Queequeg, to my\n",
      "amazement, contented himself with restricting his ablutions to his\n",
      "chest, arms, and hands. He then donned his waistcoat, and taking up a\n",
      "piece of hard soap on the wash-stand centre table, dipped it into water\n",
      "and commenced lathering his face. I was watching to see where he kept\n",
      "his razor, when lo and behold, he takes the harpoon from the bed\n",
      "corner, slips out the long wooden stock, unsheathes the head, whets it\n",
      "a little on his boot, and striding up to the bit of mirror against the\n",
      "wall, begins a vigorous scraping, or rather harpooning of his cheeks.\n",
      "Thinks I, Queequeg, this is using Rogers’s best cutlery with a\n",
      "vengeance. Afterwards I wondered the less at this operation when I came\n",
      "to know of what fine steel the head of a harpoon is made, and how\n",
      "exceedingly sharp the long straight edges are always kept.\n",
      "\n",
      "The rest of his toilet was soon achieved, and he proudly marched out of\n",
      "the room, wrapped up in his great pilot monkey jacket, and sporting his\n",
      "harpoon like a marshal’s baton.\n",

      "I quickly followed suit, and descending into the bar-room accosted the\n",

      "However, a good laugh is a mighty good thing, and rather too scarce a\n",

      "person, afford stuff for a good joke to anybody, let him not be\n",
      "backward, but let him cheerfully allow himself to spend and be spent in\n",

      "\n",

      "harpooneers, and ship keepers; a brown and brawny company, with bosky\n",

      "young fellow’s healthy cheek is like a sun-toasted pear in hue, and\n",
      "would seem to smell almost as musky; he cannot have been three days\n",
      "landed from his Indian voyage. That man next him looks a few shades\n",
      "lighter; you might say a touch of satin wood is in him. In the\n",
      "complexion of a third still lingers a tropic tawn, but slightly\n",
      "bleached withal; _he_ doubtless has tarried whole weeks ashore. But who\n",
      "could show a cheek like Queequeg? which, barred with various tints,\n",

      "These reflections just here are occasioned by the circumstance that\n",
      "after we were all seated at the table, and I was preparing to hear some\n",
      "good stories about whaling; to my no small surprise, nearly every man\n",
      "maintained a profound silence. And not only that, but they looked\n",

      "to the imminent jeopardy of many heads, and grappling the beefsteaks\n",
      "towards him. But _that_ was certainly very coolly done by him, and\n",

      "is to do it genteelly.\n",
      "\n",
      "We will not speak of all Queequeg’s peculiarities here; how he eschewed\n",
      "coffee and hot rolls, and applied his undivided attention to\n",

      "like the rest into the public room, lighted his tomahawk-pipe, and was\n",

      "robustness entered; immediately as the storm-pelted door flew back upon\n",
      "admitting him, a quick regardful eyeing of him by all the congregation,\n",
      "sufficiently attested that this fine old man was the chaplain. Yes, it\n",
      "was the famous Father Mapple, so called by the whalemen, among whom he\n",
      "was a very great favourite. He had been a sailor and a harpooneer in\n",
      "his youth, but for many years past had dedicated his life to the\n",
      "ministry. At the time I now write of, Father Mapple was in the hardy\n",
      "winter of a healthy old age; that sort of old age which seems merging\n",
      "into a second flowering youth, for among all the fissures of his\n",
      "wrinkles, there shone certain mild gleams of a newly developing\n",
      "bloom—the spring verdure peeping forth even beneath February’s snow. No\n",
      "one having previously heard his history, could for the first time\n",
      "behold Father Mapple without the utmost interest, because there were\n",
      "certain engrafted clerical peculiarities about him, imputable to that\n",
      "adventurous maritime life he had led. When he entered I observed that\n",
      "he carried no umbrella, and certainly had not come in his carriage, for\n",
      "his tarpaulin hat ran down with melting sleet, and his great pilot\n",
      "cloth jacket seemed almost to drag him to the floor with the weight of\n",
      "the water it had absorbed. However, hat and coat and overshoes were one\n",
      "by one removed, and hung up in a little space in an adjacent corner;\n",
      "when, arrayed in a decent suit, he quietly approached the pulpit.\n",
      "\n",
      "Like most old fashioned pulpits, it was a very lofty one, and since a\n",
      "regular stairs to such a height would, by its long angle with the\n",
      "floor, seriously contract the already small area of the chapel, the\n",
      "architect, it seemed, had acted upon the hint of Father Mapple, and\n",
      "finished the pulpit without a stairs, substituting a perpendicular side\n",
      "ladder, like those used in mounting a ship from a boat at sea. The wife\n",
      "of a whaling captain had provided the chapel with a handsome pair of\n",
      "red worsted man-ropes for this ladder, which, being itself nicely\n",
      "headed, and stained with a mahogany colour, the whole contrivance,\n",
      "considering what manner of chapel it was, seemed by no means in bad\n",
      "taste. Halting for an instant at the foot of the ladder, and with both\n",
      "hands grasping the ornamental knobs of the man-ropes, Father Mapple\n",
      "cast a look upwards, and then with a truly sailor-like but still\n",
      "reverential dexterity, hand over hand, mounted the steps as if\n",
      "ascending the main-top of his vessel.\n",
      "\n",
      "The perpendicular parts of this side ladder, as is usually the case\n",
      "with swinging ones, were of cloth-covered rope, only the rounds were of\n",
      "wood, so that at every step there was a joint. At my first glimpse of\n",
      "the pulpit, it had not escaped me that however convenient for a ship,\n",
      "these joints in the present instance seemed unnecessary. For I was not\n",
      "prepared to see Father Mapple after gaining the height, slowly turn\n",
      "round, and stooping over the pulpit, deliberately drag up the ladder\n",
      "step by step, till the whole was deposited within, leaving him\n",
      "impregnable in his little Quebec.\n",
      "\n",
      "I pondered some time without fully comprehending the reason for this.\n",
      "Father Mapple enjoyed such a wide reputation for sincerity and\n",
      "sanctity, that I could not suspect him of courting notoriety by any\n",
      "mere tricks of the stage. No, thought I, there must be some sober\n",
      "reason for this thing; furthermore, it must symbolize something unseen.\n",
      "Can it be, then, that by that act of physical isolation, he signifies\n",
      "his spiritual withdrawal for the time, from all outward worldly ties\n",
      "and connexions? Yes, for replenished with the meat and wine of the\n",
      "word, to the faithful man of God, this pulpit, I see, is a\n",
      "self-containing stronghold—a lofty Ehrenbreitstein, with a perennial\n",
      "well of water within the walls.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the side ladder was not the only strange feature of the place,\n",
      "borrowed from the chaplain’s former sea-farings. Between the marble\n",
      "cenotaphs on either hand of the pulpit, the wall which formed its back\n",
      "was adorned with a large painting representing a gallant ship beating\n",
      "against a terrible storm off a lee coast of black rocks and snowy\n",
      "breakers. But high above the flying scud and dark-rolling clouds, there\n",
      "floated a little isle of sunlight, from which beamed forth an angel’s\n",
      "face; and this bright face shed a distinct spot of radiance upon the\n",
      "ship’s tossed deck, something like that silver plate now inserted into\n",
      "the Victory’s plank where Nelson fell. “Ah, noble ship,” the angel\n",
      "seemed to say, “beat on, beat on, thou noble ship, and bear a hardy\n",
      "helm; for lo! the sun is breaking through; the clouds are rolling\n",
      "off—serenest azure is at hand.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Nor was the pulpit itself without a trace of the same sea-taste that\n",
      "had achieved the ladder and the picture. Its panelled front was in the\n",
      "likeness of a ship’s bluff bows, and the Holy Bible rested on a\n",
      "projecting piece of scroll work, fashioned after a ship’s fiddle-headed\n",
      "beak.\n",
      "\n",
      "What could be more full of meaning?—for the pulpit is ever this earth’s\n",
      "foremost part; all the rest comes in its rear; the pulpit leads the\n",
      "world. From thence it is the storm of God’s quick wrath is first\n",
      "descried, and the bow must bear the earliest brunt. From thence it is\n",
      "the God of breezes fair or foul is first invoked for favourable winds.\n",

      "me as a pilot of the living God. As sinful men, it is a lesson to us\n",

      "trembles, and summoning all his boldness to his face, only looks so\n",
      "much the more a coward. He will not confess himself suspected; but that\n",
      "itself is strong suspicion. So he makes the best of it; and when the\n",

      "But he rallies. ‘I seek a passage in this ship to Tarshish; how soon\n",

      "passenger.’ Ha! Jonah, that’s another stab. But he swiftly calls away\n",
      "the Captain from that scent. ‘I’ll sail with ye,’—he says,—‘the passage\n",

      "this world, shipmates, sin that pays its way can travel freely, and\n",
      "without a passport; whereas Virtue, if a pauper, is stopped at all\n",
      "frontiers. So Jonah’s Captain prepares to test the length of Jonah’s\n",
      "purse, ere he judge him openly. He charges him thrice the usual sum;\n",
      "and it’s assented to. Then the Captain knows that Jonah is a fugitive;\n",

      "laughs lowly to himself, and mutters something about the doors of\n",
      "convicts’ cells being never allowed to be locked within. All dressed\n",
      "and dusty as he is, Jonah throws himself into his berth, and finds the\n",
      "little state-room ceiling almost resting on his forehead. The air is\n",
      "close, and Jonah gasps. Then, in that contracted hole, sunk, too,\n",

      "towards me, and said it was mine. I was going to remonstrate; but he\n",
      "silenced me by pouring them into my trowsers’ pockets. I let them stay.\n",
      "He then went about his evening prayers, took out his idol, and removed\n",

      "suppose now, Ishmael, that the magnanimous God of heaven and\n",
      "earth—pagans and all included—can possibly be jealous of an\n",

      "We had lain thus in bed, chatting and napping at short intervals, and\n",
      "Queequeg now and then affectionately throwing his brown tattooed legs\n",
      "over mine, and then drawing them back; so entirely sociable and free\n",
      "and easy were we; when, at last, by reason of our confabulations, what\n",
      "little nappishness remained in us altogether departed, and we felt like\n",
      "getting up again, though day-break was yet some way down the future.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, we became very wakeful; so much so that our recumbent position\n",
      "began to grow wearisome, and by little and little we found ourselves\n",
      "sitting up; the clothes well tucked around us, leaning against the\n",
      "head-board with our four knees drawn up close together, and our two\n",
      "noses bending over them, as if our kneepans were warming-pans. We felt\n",
      "very nice and snug, the more so since it was so chilly out of doors;\n",
      "indeed out of bed-clothes too, seeing that there was no fire in the\n",
      "room. The more so, I say, because truly to enjoy bodily warmth, some\n",
      "small part of you must be cold, for there is no quality in this world\n",
      "that is not what it is merely by contrast. Nothing exists in itself. If\n",
      "you flatter yourself that you are all over comfortable, and have been\n",
      "so a long time, then you cannot be said to be comfortable any more. But\n",
      "if, like Queequeg and me in the bed, the tip of your nose or the crown\n",
      "of your head be slightly chilled, why then, indeed, in the general\n",
      "consciousness you feel most delightfully and unmistakably warm. For\n",
      "this reason a sleeping apartment should never be furnished with a fire,\n",
      "which is one of the luxurious discomforts of the rich. For the height\n",
      "of this sort of deliciousness is to have nothing but the blanket\n",
      "between you and your snugness and the cold of the outer air. Then there\n",
      "you lie like the one warm spark in the heart of an arctic crystal.\n",
      "\n",
      "We had been sitting in this crouching manner for some time, when all at\n",

      "by day or by night, and whether asleep or awake, I have a way of always\n",
      "keeping my eyes shut, in order the more to concentrate the snugness of\n",
      "being in bed. Because no man can ever feel his own identity aright\n",
      "except his eyes be closed; as if darkness were indeed the proper\n",
      "element of our essences, though light be more congenial to our clayey\n",

      "self-created darkness into the imposed and coarse outer gloom of the\n",
      "unilluminated twelve-o’clock-at-night, I experienced a disagreeable\n",
      "revulsion. Nor did I at all object to the hint from Queequeg that\n",
      "perhaps it were best to strike a light, seeing that we were so wide\n",
      "awake; and besides he felt a strong desire to have a few quiet puffs\n",

      "elastic our stiff prejudices grow when love once comes to bend them.\n",
      "For now I liked nothing better than to have Queequeg smoking by me,\n",
      "even in bed, because he seemed to be full of such serene household joy\n",

      "Queequeg was a native of Rokovoko, an island far away to the West and\n",
      "South. It is not down in any map; true places never are.\n",
      "\n",
      "When a new-hatched savage running wild about his native woodlands in a\n",
      "grass clout, followed by the nibbling goats, as if he were a green\n",
      "sapling; even then, in Queequeg’s ambitious soul, lurked a strong\n",
      "desire to see something more of Christendom than a specimen whaler or\n",
      "two. His father was a High Chief, a King; his uncle a High Priest; and\n",
      "on the maternal side he boasted aunts who were the wives of\n",
      "unconquerable warriors. There was excellent blood in his veins—royal\n",
      "stuff; though sadly vitiated, I fear, by the cannibal propensity he\n",
      "nourished in his untutored youth.\n",
      "\n",
      "A Sag Harbor ship visited his father’s bay, and Queequeg sought a\n",
      "passage to Christian lands. But the ship, having her full complement of\n",
      "seamen, spurned his suit; and not all the King his father’s influence\n",
      "could prevail. But Queequeg vowed a vow. Alone in his canoe, he paddled\n",
      "off to a distant strait, which he knew the ship must pass through when\n",
      "she quitted the island. On one side was a coral reef; on the other a\n",
      "low tongue of land, covered with mangrove thickets that grew out into\n",
      "the water. Hiding his canoe, still afloat, among these thickets, with\n",
      "its prow seaward, he sat down in the stern, paddle low in hand; and\n",
      "when the ship was gliding by, like a flash he darted out; gained her\n",
      "side; with one backward dash of his foot capsized and sank his canoe;\n",
      "climbed up the chains; and throwing himself at full length upon the\n",
      "deck, grappled a ring-bolt there, and swore not to let it go, though\n",
      "hacked in pieces.\n",
      "\n",
      "In vain the captain threatened to throw him overboard; suspended a\n",
      "cutlass over his naked wrists; Queequeg was the son of a King, and\n",
      "Queequeg budged not. Struck by his desperate dauntlessness, and his\n",
      "wild desire to visit Christendom, the captain at last relented, and\n",
      "told him he might make himself at home. But this fine young savage—this\n",
      "sea Prince of Wales, never saw the Captain’s cabin. They put him down\n",
      "among the sailors, and made a whaleman of him. But like Czar Peter\n",
      "content to toil in the shipyards of foreign cities, Queequeg disdained\n",
      "no seeming ignominy, if thereby he might happily gain the power of\n",
      "enlightening his untutored countrymen. For at bottom—so he told me—he\n",
      "was actuated by a profound desire to learn among the Christians, the\n",
      "arts whereby to make his people still happier than they were; and more\n",
      "than that, still better than they were. But, alas! the practices of\n",
      "whalemen soon convinced him that even Christians could be both\n",
      "miserable and wicked; infinitely more so, than all his father’s\n",
      "heathens. Arrived at last in old Sag Harbor; and seeing what the\n",
      "sailors did there; and then going on to Nantucket, and seeing how they\n",
      "spent their wages in _that_ place also, poor Queequeg gave it up for\n",
      "lost. Thought he, it’s a wicked world in all meridians; I’ll die a\n",
      "pagan.\n",
      "\n",
      "And thus an old idolator at heart, he yet lived among these Christians,\n",
      "wore their clothes, and tried to talk their gibberish. Hence the queer\n",
      "ways about him, though now some time from home.\n",
      "\n",
      "By hints, I asked him whether he did not propose going back, and having\n",
      "a coronation; since he might now consider his father dead and gone, he\n",
      "being very old and feeble at the last accounts. He answered no, not\n",
      "yet; and added that he was fearful Christianity, or rather Christians,\n",
      "had unfitted him for ascending the pure and undefiled throne of thirty\n",
      "pagan Kings before him. But by and by, he said, he would return,—as\n",
      "soon as he felt himself baptized again. For the nonce, however, he\n",
      "proposed to sail about, and sow his wild oats in all four oceans. They\n",
      "had made a harpooneer of him, and that barbed iron was in lieu of a\n",
      "sceptre now.\n",
      "\n",
      "I asked him what might be his immediate purpose, touching his future\n",
      "movements. He answered, to go to sea again, in his old vocation. Upon\n",
      "this, I told him that whaling was my own design, and informed him of my\n",
      "intention to sail out of Nantucket, as being the most promising port\n",
      "for an adventurous whaleman to embark from. He at once resolved to\n",
      "accompany me to that island, ship aboard the same vessel, get into the\n",
      "same watch, the same boat, the same mess with me, in short to share my\n",
      "every hap; with both my hands in his, boldly dip into the Potluck of\n",
      "both worlds. To all this I joyously assented; for besides the affection\n",
      "I now felt for Queequeg, he was an experienced harpooneer, and as such,\n",
      "could not fail to be of great usefulness to one, who, like me, was\n",
      "wholly ignorant of the mysteries of whaling, though well acquainted\n",
      "with the sea, as known to merchant seamen.\n",
      "\n",
      "His story being ended with his pipe’s last dying puff, Queequeg\n",

      "\n",
      "Next morning, Monday, after disposing of the embalmed head to a barber,\n",
      "for a block, I settled my own and comrade’s bill; using, however, my\n",
      "comrade’s money. The grinning landlord, as well as the boarders, seemed\n",
      "amazingly tickled at the sudden friendship which had sprung up between\n",
      "me and Queequeg—especially as Peter Coffin’s cock and bull stories\n",
      "about him had previously so much alarmed me concerning the very person\n",
      "whom I now companied with.\n",
      "\n",
      "We borrowed a wheelbarrow, and embarking our things, including my own\n",
      "poor carpet-bag, and Queequeg’s canvas sack and hammock, away we went\n",
      "down to “the Moss,” the little Nantucket packet schooner moored at the\n",
      "wharf. As we were going along the people stared; not at Queequeg so\n",
      "much—for they were used to seeing cannibals like him in their\n",
      "streets,—but at seeing him and me upon such confidential terms. But we\n",
      "heeded them not, going along wheeling the barrow by turns, and Queequeg\n",
      "now and then stopping to adjust the sheath on his harpoon barbs. I\n",
      "asked him why he carried such a troublesome thing with him ashore, and\n",
      "whether all whaling ships did not find their own harpoons. To this, in\n",
      "substance, he replied, that though what I hinted was true enough, yet\n",
      "he had a particular affection for his own harpoon, because it was of\n",
      "assured stuff, well tried in many a mortal combat, and deeply intimate\n",
      "with the hearts of whales. In short, like many inland reapers and\n",
      "mowers, who go into the farmers’ meadows armed with their own\n",
      "scythes—though in no wise obliged to furnish them—even so, Queequeg,\n",
      "for his own private reasons, preferred his own harpoon.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shifting the barrow from my hand to his, he told me a funny story about\n",
      "the first wheelbarrow he had ever seen. It was in Sag Harbor. The\n",
      "owners of his ship, it seems, had lent him one, in which to carry his\n",
      "heavy chest to his boarding house. Not to seem ignorant about the\n",
      "thing—though in truth he was entirely so, concerning the precise way in\n",
      "which to manage the barrow—Queequeg puts his chest upon it; lashes it\n",
      "fast; and then shoulders the barrow and marches up the wharf. “Why,”\n",
      "said I, “Queequeg, you might have known better than that, one would\n",
      "think. Didn’t the people laugh?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Upon this, he told me another story. The people of his island of\n",
      "Rokovoko, it seems, at their wedding feasts express the fragrant water\n",
      "of young cocoanuts into a large stained calabash like a punchbowl; and\n",
      "this punchbowl always forms the great central ornament on the braided\n",
      "mat where the feast is held. Now a certain grand merchant ship once\n",
      "touched at Rokovoko, and its commander—from all accounts, a very\n",
      "stately punctilious gentleman, at least for a sea captain—this\n",
      "commander was invited to the wedding feast of Queequeg’s sister, a\n",
      "pretty young princess just turned of ten. Well; when all the wedding\n",
      "guests were assembled at the bride’s bamboo cottage, this Captain\n",
      "marches in, and being assigned the post of honor, placed himself over\n",
      "against the punchbowl, and between the High Priest and his majesty the\n",
      "King, Queequeg’s father. Grace being said,—for those people have their\n",
      "grace as well as we—though Queequeg told me that unlike us, who at such\n",
      "times look downwards to our platters, they, on the contrary, copying\n",
      "the ducks, glance upwards to the great Giver of all feasts—Grace, I\n",
      "say, being said, the High Priest opens the banquet by the immemorial\n",
      "ceremony of the island; that is, dipping his consecrated and\n",
      "consecrating fingers into the bowl before the blessed beverage\n",
      "circulates. Seeing himself placed next the Priest, and noting the\n",
      "ceremony, and thinking himself—being Captain of a ship—as having plain\n",
      "precedence over a mere island King, especially in the King’s own\n",
      "house—the Captain coolly proceeds to wash his hands in the\n",
      "punchbowl;—taking it I suppose for a huge finger-glass. “Now,” said\n",
      "Queequeg, “what you tink now?—Didn’t our people laugh?”\n",
      "\n",
      "At last, passage paid, and luggage safe, we stood on board the\n",
      "schooner. Hoisting sail, it glided down the Acushnet river. On one\n",
      "side, New Bedford rose in terraces of streets, their ice-covered trees\n",
      "all glittering in the clear, cold air. Huge hills and mountains of\n",
      "casks on casks were piled upon her wharves, and side by side the\n",
      "world-wandering whale ships lay silent and safely moored at last; while\n",
      "from others came a sound of carpenters and coopers, with blended noises\n",
      "of fires and forges to melt the pitch, all betokening that new cruises\n",
      "were on the start; that one most perilous and long voyage ended, only\n",
      "begins a second; and a second ended, only begins a third, and so on,\n",
      "for ever and for aye. Such is the endlessness, yea, the intolerableness\n",
      "of all earthly effort.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gaining the more open water, the bracing breeze waxed fresh; the little\n",
      "Moss tossed the quick foam from her bows, as a young colt his\n",

      "earth!—that common highway all over dented with the marks of slavish\n",

      "which will permit no records.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the same foam-fountain, Queequeg seemed to drink and reel with me.\n",
      "His dusky nostrils swelled apart; he showed his filed and pointed\n",
      "teeth. On, on we flew; and our offing gained, the Moss did homage to\n",
      "the blast; ducked and dived her bows as a slave before the Sultan.\n",
      "Sideways leaning, we sideways darted; every ropeyarn tingling like a\n",
      "wire; the two tall masts buckling like Indian canes in land tornadoes.\n",
      "So full of this reeling scene were we, as we stood by the plunging\n",
      "bowsprit, that for some time we did not notice the jeering glances of\n",
      "the passengers, a lubber-like assembly, who marvelled that two fellow\n",
      "beings should be so companionable; as though a white man were anything\n",
      "more dignified than a whitewashed negro. But there were some boobies\n",
      "and bumpkins there, who, by their intense greenness, must have come\n",
      "from the heart and centre of all verdure. Queequeg caught one of these\n",
      "young saplings mimicking him behind his back. I thought the bumpkin’s\n",
      "hour of doom was come. Dropping his harpoon, the brawny savage caught\n",
      "him in his arms, and by an almost miraculous dexterity and strength,\n",
      "sent him high up bodily into the air; then slightly tapping his stern\n",
      "in mid-somerset, the fellow landed with bursting lungs upon his feet,\n",
      "while Queequeg, turning his back upon him, lighted his tomahawk pipe\n",
      "and passed it to me for a puff.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Capting! Capting!” yelled the bumpkin, running towards that officer;\n",
      "“Capting, Capting, here’s the devil.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hallo, _you_ sir,” cried the Captain, a gaunt rib of the sea, stalking\n",
      "up to Queequeg, “what in thunder do you mean by that? Don’t you know\n",
      "you might have killed that chap?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What him say?” said Queequeg, as he mildly turned to me.\n",
      "\n",
      "“He say,” said I, “that you came near kill-e that man there,” pointing\n",
      "to the still shivering greenhorn.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Kill-e,” cried Queequeg, twisting his tattooed face into an unearthly\n",
      "expression of disdain, “ah! him bevy small-e fish-e; Queequeg no kill-e\n",
      "so small-e fish-e; Queequeg kill-e big whale!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Look you,” roared the Captain, “I’ll kill-e _you_, you cannibal, if\n",
      "you try any more of your tricks aboard here; so mind your eye.”\n",
      "\n",
      "But it so happened just then, that it was high time for the Captain to\n",
      "mind his own eye. The prodigious strain upon the main-sail had parted\n",
      "the weather-sheet, and the tremendous boom was now flying from side to\n",
      "side, completely sweeping the entire after part of the deck. The poor\n",
      "fellow whom Queequeg had handled so roughly, was swept overboard; all\n",
      "hands were in a panic; and to attempt snatching at the boom to stay it,\n",
      "seemed madness. It flew from right to left, and back again, almost in\n",
      "one ticking of a watch, and every instant seemed on the point of\n",
      "snapping into splinters. Nothing was done, and nothing seemed capable\n",
      "of being done; those on deck rushed towards the bows, and stood eyeing\n",
      "the boom as if it were the lower jaw of an exasperated whale. In the\n",
      "midst of this consternation, Queequeg dropped deftly to his knees, and\n",
      "crawling under the path of the boom, whipped hold of a rope, secured\n",
      "one end to the bulwarks, and then flinging the other like a lasso,\n",
      "caught it round the boom as it swept over his head, and at the next\n",
      "jerk, the spar was that way trapped, and all was safe. The schooner was\n",
      "run into the wind, and while the hands were clearing away the stern\n",
      "boat, Queequeg, stripped to the waist, darted from the side with a long\n",
      "living arc of a leap. For three minutes or more he was seen swimming\n",
      "like a dog, throwing his long arms straight out before him, and by\n",
      "turns revealing his brawny shoulders through the freezing foam. I\n",
      "looked at the grand and glorious fellow, but saw no one to be saved.\n",

      "more, and he rose again, one arm still striking out, and with the other\n",
      "dragging a lifeless form. The boat soon picked them up. The poor\n",

      "Nothing more happened on the passage worthy the mentioning; so, after a\n",
      "fine run, we safely arrived in Nantucket.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nantucket! Take out your map and look at it. See what a real corner of\n",
      "the world it occupies; how it stands there, away off shore, more lonely\n",
      "than the Eddystone lighthouse. Look at it—a mere hillock, and elbow of\n",
      "sand; all beach, without a background. There is more sand there than\n",
      "you would use in twenty years as a substitute for blotting paper. Some\n",
      "gamesome wights will tell you that they have to plant weeds there, they\n",
      "don’t grow naturally; that they import Canada thistles; that they have\n",
      "to send beyond seas for a spile to stop a leak in an oil cask; that\n",
      "pieces of wood in Nantucket are carried about like bits of the true\n",
      "cross in Rome; that people there plant toadstools before their houses,\n",
      "to get under the shade in summer time; that one blade of grass makes an\n",
      "oasis, three blades in a day’s walk a prairie; that they wear quicksand\n",
      "shoes, something like Laplander snow-shoes; that they are so shut up,\n",
      "belted about, every way inclosed, surrounded, and made an utter island\n",
      "of by the ocean, that to their very chairs and tables small clams will\n",
      "sometimes be found adhering, as to the backs of sea turtles. But these\n",
      "extravaganzas only show that Nantucket is no Illinois.\n",
      "\n",
      "Look now at the wondrous traditional story of how this island was\n",
      "settled by the red-men. Thus goes the legend. In olden times an eagle\n",
      "swooped down upon the New England coast, and carried off an infant\n",
      "Indian in his talons. With loud lament the parents saw their child\n",
      "borne out of sight over the wide waters. They resolved to follow in the\n",
      "same direction. Setting out in their canoes, after a perilous passage\n",
      "they discovered the island, and there they found an empty ivory\n",
      "casket,—the poor little Indian’s skeleton.\n",
      "\n",
      "What wonder, then, that these Nantucketers, born on a beach, should\n",
      "take to the sea for a livelihood! They first caught crabs and quohogs\n",
      "in the sand; grown bolder, they waded out with nets for mackerel; more\n",
      "experienced, they pushed off in boats and captured cod; and at last,\n",
      "launching a navy of great ships on the sea, explored this watery world;\n",
      "put an incessant belt of circumnavigations round it; peeped in at\n",
      "Behring’s Straits; and in all seasons and all oceans declared\n",
      "everlasting war with the mightiest animated mass that has survived the\n",
      "flood; most monstrous and most mountainous! That Himmalehan, salt-sea\n",

      "his very panics are more to be dreaded than his most fearless and\n",
      "malicious assaults!\n",

      "And thus have these naked Nantucketers, these sea hermits, issuing from\n",
      "their ant-hill in the sea, overrun and conquered the watery world like\n",
      "so many Alexanders; parcelling out among them the Atlantic, Pacific,\n",
      "and Indian oceans, as the three pirate powers did Poland. Let America\n",
      "add Mexico to Texas, and pile Cuba upon Canada; let the English\n",
      "overswarm all India, and hang out their blazing banner from the sun;\n",
      "two thirds of this terraqueous globe are the Nantucketer’s. For the sea\n",

      "following the sea as highwaymen the road, they but plunder other ships,\n",
      "other fragments of the land like themselves, without seeking to draw\n",
      "their living from the bottomless deep itself. The Nantucketer, he alone\n",

      "_There_ is his home; _there_ lies his business, which a Noah’s flood\n",

      "He lives on the sea, as prairie cocks in the prairie; he hides among\n",
      "the waves, he climbs them as chamois hunters climb the Alps. For years\n",
      "he knows not the land; so that when he comes to it at last, it smells\n",
      "like another world, more strangely than the moon would to an Earthsman.\n",
      "With the landless gull, that at sunset folds her wings and is rocked to\n",

      "\n",
      "It was quite late in the evening when the little Moss came snugly to\n",
      "anchor, and Queequeg and I went ashore; so we could attend to no\n",
      "business that day, at least none but a supper and a bed. The landlord\n",
      "of the Spouter-Inn had recommended us to his cousin Hosea Hussey of the\n",

      "hotels in all Nantucket, and moreover he had assured us that Cousin\n",
      "Hosea, as he called him, was famous for his chowders. In short, he\n",
      "plainly hinted that we could not possibly do better than try pot-luck\n",
      "at the Try Pots. But the directions he had given us about keeping a\n",
      "yellow warehouse on our starboard hand till we opened a white church to\n",

      "corner three points to the starboard, and that done, then ask the first\n",
      "man we met where the place was: these crooked directions of his very\n",
      "much puzzled us at first, especially as, at the outset, Queequeg\n",
      "insisted that the yellow warehouse—our first point of departure—must be\n",
      "left on the larboard hand, whereas I had understood Peter Coffin to say\n",
      "it was on the starboard. However, by dint of beating about a little in\n",
      "the dark, and now and then knocking up a peaceable inhabitant to\n",
      "inquire the way, we at last came to something which there was no\n",
      "mistaking.\n",
      "\n",
      "Two enormous wooden pots painted black, and suspended by asses’ ears,\n",
      "swung from the cross-trees of an old top-mast, planted in front of an\n",
      "old doorway. The horns of the cross-trees were sawed off on the other\n",
      "side, so that this old top-mast looked not a little like a gallows.\n",
      "Perhaps I was over sensitive to such impressions at the time, but I\n",
      "could not help staring at this gallows with a vague misgiving. A sort\n",
      "of crick was in my neck as I gazed up to the two remaining horns; yes,\n",
      "_two_ of them, one for Queequeg, and one for me. It’s ominous, thinks\n",
      "I. A Coffin my Innkeeper upon landing in my first whaling port;\n",
      "tombstones staring at me in the whalemen’s chapel; and here a gallows!\n",
      "and a pair of prodigious black pots too! Are these last throwing out\n",
      "oblique hints touching Tophet?\n",
      "\n",
      "I was called from these reflections by the sight of a freckled woman\n",
      "with yellow hair and a yellow gown, standing in the porch of the inn,\n",
      "under a dull red lamp swinging there, that looked much like an injured\n",

      "Mrs. Hussey entirely competent to attend to all his affairs. Upon\n",
      "making known our desires for a supper and a bed, Mrs. Hussey,\n",
      "postponing further scolding for the present, ushered us into a little\n",
      "room, and seating us at a table spread with the relics of a recently\n",
      "concluded repast, turned round to us and said—“Clam or Cod?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What’s that about Cods, ma’am?” said I, with much politeness.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Clam or Cod?” she repeated.\n",
      "\n",
      "“A clam for supper? a cold clam; is _that_ what you mean, Mrs. Hussey?”\n",
      "says I, “but that’s a rather cold and clammy reception in the winter\n",

      "But being in a great hurry to resume scolding the man in the purple\n",

      "to the kitchen, and bawling out “clam for two,” disappeared.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Queequeg,” said I, “do you think that we can make out a supper for us\n",
      "both on one clam?”\n",
      "\n",
      "However, a warm savory steam from the kitchen served to belie the\n",
      "apparently cheerless prospect before us. But when that smoking chowder\n",
      "came in, the mystery was delightfully explained. Oh, sweet friends!\n",
      "hearken to me. It was made of small juicy clams, scarcely bigger than\n",
      "hazel nuts, mixed with pounded ship biscuit, and salted pork cut up\n",
      "into little flakes; the whole enriched with butter, and plentifully\n",
      "seasoned with pepper and salt. Our appetites being sharpened by the\n",
      "frosty voyage, and in particular, Queequeg seeing his favourite fishing\n",
      "food before him, and the chowder being surpassingly excellent, we\n",
      "despatched it with great expedition: when leaning back a moment and\n",
      "bethinking me of Mrs. Hussey’s clam and cod announcement, I thought I\n",
      "would try a little experiment. Stepping to the kitchen door, I uttered\n",
      "the word “cod” with great emphasis, and resumed my seat. In a few\n",
      "moments the savoury steam came forth again, but with a different\n",
      "flavor, and in good time a fine cod-chowder was placed before us.\n",
      "\n",
      "We resumed business; and while plying our spoons in the bowl, thinks I\n",
      "to myself, I wonder now if this here has any effect on the head? What’s\n",
      "that stultifying saying about chowder-headed people? “But look,\n",
      "Queequeg, ain’t that a live eel in your bowl? Where’s your harpoon?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Fishiest of all fishy places was the Try Pots, which well deserved its\n",
      "name; for the pots there were always boiling chowders. Chowder for\n",
      "breakfast, and chowder for dinner, and chowder for supper, till you\n",
      "began to look for fish-bones coming through your clothes. The area\n",
      "before the house was paved with clam-shells. Mrs. Hussey wore a\n",
      "polished necklace of codfish vertebra; and Hosea Hussey had his account\n",
      "books bound in superior old shark-skin. There was a fishy flavor to the\n",
      "milk, too, which I could not at all account for, till one morning\n",
      "happening to take a stroll along the beach among some fishermen’s\n",
      "boats, I saw Hosea’s brindled cow feeding on fish remnants, and\n",
      "marching along the sand with each foot in a cod’s decapitated head,\n",
      "looking very slip-shod, I assure ye.\n",

      "“every true whaleman sleeps with his harpoon—but why not?” “Because\n",
      "it’s dangerous,” says she. “Ever since young Stiggs coming from that\n",

      "small concern, Queequeg now gave me to understand, that he had been\n",
      "diligently consulting Yojo—the name of his black little god—and Yojo\n",
      "had told him two or three times over, and strongly insisted upon it\n",
      "everyway, that instead of our going together among the whaling-fleet in\n",
      "harbor, and in concert selecting our craft; instead of this, I say,\n",
      "Yojo earnestly enjoined that the selection of the ship should rest\n",
      "wholly with me, inasmuch as Yojo purposed befriending us; and, in order\n",
      "to do so, had already pitched upon a vessel, which, if left to myself,\n",
      "I, Ishmael, should infallibly light upon, for all the world as though\n",
      "it had turned out by chance; and in that vessel I must immediately ship\n",
      "myself, for the present irrespective of Queequeg.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have forgotten to mention that, in many things, Queequeg placed great\n",
      "confidence in the excellence of Yojo’s judgment and surprising forecast\n",
      "of things; and cherished Yojo with considerable esteem, as a rather\n",
      "good sort of god, who perhaps meant well enough upon the whole, but in\n",
      "all cases did not succeed in his benevolent designs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, this plan of Queequeg’s, or rather Yojo’s, touching the selection\n",
      "of our craft; I did not like that plan at all. I had not a little\n",
      "relied upon Queequeg’s sagacity to point out the whaler best fitted to\n",
      "carry us and our fortunes securely. But as all my remonstrances\n",
      "produced no effect upon Queequeg, I was obliged to acquiesce; and\n",
      "accordingly prepared to set about this business with a determined\n",
      "rushing sort of energy and vigor, that should quickly settle that\n",
      "trifling little affair. Next morning early, leaving Queequeg shut up\n",
      "with Yojo in our little bedroom—for it seemed that it was some sort of\n",
      "Lent or Ramadan, or day of fasting, humiliation, and prayer with\n",
      "Queequeg and Yojo that day; _how_ it was I never could find out, for,\n",
      "though I applied myself to it several times, I never could master his\n",
      "liturgies and XXXIX Articles—leaving Queequeg, then, fasting on his\n",
      "tomahawk pipe, and Yojo warming himself at his sacrificial fire of\n",
      "shavings, I sallied out among the shipping. After much prolonged\n",
      "sauntering and many random inquiries, I learnt that there were three\n",
      "ships up for three-years’ voyages—The Devil-dam, the Tit-bit, and the\n",
      "Pequod. _Devil-Dam_, I do not know the origin of; _Tit-bit_ is obvious;\n",
      "_Pequod_, you will no doubt remember, was the name of a celebrated\n",
      "tribe of Massachusetts Indians; now extinct as the ancient Medes. I\n",
      "peered and pryed about the Devil-dam; from her, hopped over to the\n",
      "Tit-bit; and finally, going on board the Pequod, looked around her for\n",
      "a moment, and then decided that this was the very ship for us.\n",
      "\n",
      "You may have seen many a quaint craft in your day, for aught I\n",
      "know;—square-toed luggers; mountainous Japanese junks; butter-box\n",
      "galliots, and what not; but take my word for it, you never saw such a\n",
      "rare old craft as this same rare old Pequod. She was a ship of the old\n",
      "school, rather small if anything; with an old-fashioned claw-footed\n",
      "look about her. Long seasoned and weather-stained in the typhoons and\n",
      "calms of all four oceans, her old hull’s complexion was darkened like a\n",
      "French grenadier’s, who has alike fought in Egypt and Siberia. Her\n",
      "venerable bows looked bearded. Her masts—cut somewhere on the coast of\n",
      "Japan, where her original ones were lost overboard in a gale—her masts\n",
      "stood stiffly up like the spines of the three old kings of Cologne. Her\n",
      "ancient decks were worn and wrinkled, like the pilgrim-worshipped\n",
      "flag-stone in Canterbury Cathedral where Becket bled. But to all these\n",
      "her old antiquities, were added new and marvellous features, pertaining\n",
      "to the wild business that for more than half a century she had\n",
      "followed. Old Captain Peleg, many years her chief-mate, before he\n",
      "commanded another vessel of his own, and now a retired seaman, and one\n",
      "of the principal owners of the Pequod,—this old Peleg, during the term\n",
      "of his chief-mateship, had built upon her original grotesqueness, and\n",
      "inlaid it, all over, with a quaintness both of material and device,\n",
      "unmatched by anything except it be Thorkill-Hake’s carved buckler or\n",
      "bedstead. She was apparelled like any barbaric Ethiopian emperor, his\n",
      "neck heavy with pendants of polished ivory. She was a thing of\n",
      "trophies. A cannibal of a craft, tricking herself forth in the chased\n",
      "bones of her enemies. All round, her unpanelled, open bulwarks were\n",
      "garnished like one continuous jaw, with the long sharp teeth of the\n",
      "sperm whale, inserted there for pins, to fasten her old hempen thews\n",
      "and tendons to. Those thews ran not through base blocks of land wood,\n",
      "but deftly travelled over sheaves of sea-ivory. Scorning a turnstile\n",
      "wheel at her reverend helm, she sported there a tiller; and that tiller\n",
      "was in one mass, curiously carved from the long narrow lower jaw of her\n",
      "hereditary foe. The helmsman who steered by that tiller in a tempest,\n",
      "felt like the Tartar, when he holds back his fiery steed by clutching\n",
      "its jaw. A noble craft, but somehow a most melancholy! All noble things\n",
      "are touched with that.\n",

      "Now when I looked about the quarter-deck, for some one having\n",
      "authority, in order to propose myself as a candidate for the voyage, at\n",
      "first I saw nobody; but I could not well overlook a strange sort of\n",
      "tent, or rather wigwam, pitched a little behind the main-mast. It\n",
      "seemed only a temporary erection used in port. It was of a conical\n",
      "shape, some ten feet high; consisting of the long, huge slabs of limber\n",
      "black bone taken from the middle and highest part of the jaws of the\n",
      "right-whale. Planted with their broad ends on the deck, a circle of\n",
      "these slabs laced together, mutually sloped towards each other, and at\n",
      "the apex united in a tufted point, where the loose hairy fibres waved\n",
      "to and fro like the top-knot on some old Pottowottamie Sachem’s head. A\n",
      "triangular opening faced towards the bows of the ship, so that the\n",
      "insider commanded a complete view forward.\n",
      "\n",
      "And half concealed in this queer tenement, I at length found one who by\n",
      "his aspect seemed to have authority; and who, it being noon, and the\n",
      "ship’s work suspended, was now enjoying respite from the burden of\n",
      "command. He was seated on an old-fashioned oaken chair, wriggling all\n",
      "over with curious carving; and the bottom of which was formed of a\n",
      "stout interlacing of the same elastic stuff of which the wigwam was\n",
      "constructed.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was nothing so very particular, perhaps, about the appearance of\n",
      "the elderly man I saw; he was brown and brawny, like most old seamen,\n",
      "and heavily rolled up in blue pilot-cloth, cut in the Quaker style;\n",
      "only there was a fine and almost microscopic net-work of the minutest\n",
      "wrinkles interlacing round his eyes, which must have arisen from his\n",
      "continual sailings in many hard gales, and always looking to\n",

      "\n",
      "“And thou mayest as well sign the papers right off,” he added—“come\n",

      "Seated on the transom was what seemed to me a most uncommon and\n",
      "surprising figure. It turned out to be Captain Bildad, who along with\n",
      "Captain Peleg was one of the largest owners of the vessel; the other\n",
      "shares, as is sometimes the case in these ports, being held by a crowd\n",
      "of old annuitants; widows, fatherless children, and chancery wards;\n",
      "each owning about the value of a timber head, or a foot of plank, or a\n",
      "nail or two in the ship. People in Nantucket invest their money in\n",

      "things altogether alien and heterogeneous. For some of these same\n",
      "Quakers are the most sanguinary of all sailors and whale-hunters. They\n",

      "Scripture names—a singularly common fashion on the island—and in\n",

      "unoutgrown peculiarities, a thousand bold dashes of character, not\n",
      "unworthy a Scandinavian sea-king, or a poetical Pagan Roman. And when\n",
      "these things unite in a man of greatly superior natural force, with a\n",
      "globular brain and a ponderous heart; who has also by the stillness and\n",
      "seclusion of many long night-watches in the remotest waters, and\n",
      "beneath constellations never seen here at the north, been led to think\n",
      "untraditionally and independently; receiving all nature’s sweet or\n",
      "savage impressions fresh from her own virgin voluntary and confiding\n",

      "sure of this, O young ambition, all mortal greatness is but disease.\n",
      "But, as yet we have not to do with such an one, but with quite another;\n",
      "and still a man, who, if indeed peculiar, it only results again from\n",
      "another phase of the Quaker, modified by individual circumstances.\n",
      "\n",
      "Like Captain Peleg, Captain Bildad was a well-to-do, retired whaleman.\n",
      "But unlike Captain Peleg—who cared not a rush for what are called\n",
      "serious things, and indeed deemed those self-same serious things the\n",
      "veriest of all trifles—Captain Bildad had not only been originally\n",
      "educated according to the strictest sect of Nantucket Quakerism, but\n",
      "all his subsequent ocean life, and the sight of many unclad, lovely\n",
      "island creatures, round the Horn—all that had not moved this native\n",
      "born Quaker one single jot, had not so much as altered one angle of his\n",
      "vest. Still, for all this immutableness, was there some lack of common\n",
      "consistency about worthy Captain Bildad. Though refusing, from\n",
      "conscientious scruples, to bear arms against land invaders, yet himself\n",
      "had illimitably invaded the Atlantic and Pacific; and though a sworn\n",
      "foe to human bloodshed, yet had he in his straight-bodied coat, spilled\n",
      "tuns upon tuns of leviathan gore. How now in the contemplative evening\n",
      "of his days, the pious Bildad reconciled these things in the\n",
      "reminiscence, I do not know; but it did not seem to concern him much,\n",
      "and very probably he had long since come to the sage and sensible\n",
      "conclusion that a man’s religion is one thing, and this practical world\n",
      "quite another. This world pays dividends. Rising from a little\n",
      "cabin-boy in short clothes of the drabbest drab, to a harpooneer in a\n",
      "broad shad-bellied waistcoat; from that becoming boat-header,\n",
      "chief-mate, and captain, and finally a ship owner; Bildad, as I hinted\n",
      "before, had concluded his adventurous career by wholly retiring from\n",
      "active life at the goodly age of sixty, and dedicating his remaining\n",
      "days to the quiet receiving of his well-earned income.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, Bildad, I am sorry to say, had the reputation of being an\n",
      "incorrigible old hunks, and in his sea-going days, a bitter, hard\n",
      "task-master. They told me in Nantucket, though it certainly seems a\n",
      "curious story, that when he sailed the old Categut whaleman, his crew,\n",
      "upon arriving home, were mostly all carried ashore to the hospital,\n",
      "sore exhausted and worn out. For a pious man, especially for a Quaker,\n",
      "he was certainly rather hard-hearted, to say the least. He never used\n",
      "to swear, though, at his men, they said; but somehow he got an\n",
      "inordinate quantity of cruel, unmitigated hard work out of them. When\n",
      "Bildad was a chief-mate, to have his drab-coloured eye intently looking\n",
      "at you, made you feel completely nervous, till you could clutch\n",
      "something—a hammer or a marling-spike, and go to work like mad, at\n",
      "something or other, never mind what. Indolence and idleness perished\n",
      "before him. His own person was the exact embodiment of his utilitarian\n",
      "character. On his long, gaunt body, he carried no spare flesh, no\n",
      "superfluous beard, his chin having a soft, economical nap to it, like\n",
      "the worn nap of his broad-brimmed hat.\n",
      "\n",
      "Such, then, was the person that I saw seated on the transom when I\n",
      "followed Captain Peleg down into the cabin. The space between the decks\n",
      "was small; and there, bolt-upright, sat old Bildad, who always sat so,\n",
      "and never leaned, and this to save his coat tails. His broad-brim was\n",
      "placed beside him; his legs were stiffly crossed; his drab vesture was\n",
      "buttoned up to his chin; and spectacles on nose, he seemed absorbed in\n",
      "reading from a ponderous volume.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Bildad,” cried Captain Peleg, “at it again, Bildad, eh? Ye have been\n",
      "studying those Scriptures, now, for the last thirty years, to my\n",
      "certain knowledge. How far ye got, Bildad?”\n",
      "\n",
      "As if long habituated to such profane talk from his old shipmate,\n",
      "Bildad, without noticing his present irreverence, quietly looked up,\n",
      "and seeing me, glanced again inquiringly towards Peleg.\n",
      "\n",
      "“He says he’s our man, Bildad,” said Peleg, “he wants to ship.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Dost thee?” said Bildad, in a hollow tone, and turning round to me.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I _dost_,” said I unconsciously, he was so intense a Quaker.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What do ye think of him, Bildad?” said Peleg.\n",
      "\n",
      "“He’ll do,” said Bildad, eyeing me, and then went on spelling away at\n",
      "his book in a mumbling tone quite audible.\n",
      "\n",
      "I thought him the queerest old Quaker I ever saw, especially as Peleg,\n",
      "his friend and old shipmate, seemed such a blusterer. But I said\n",
      "nothing, only looking round me sharply. Peleg now threw open a chest,\n",
      "and drawing forth the ship’s articles, placed pen and ink before him,\n",
      "and seated himself at a little table. I began to think it was high time\n",
      "to settle with myself at what terms I would be willing to engage for\n",
      "the voyage. I was already aware that in the whaling business they paid\n",
      "no wages; but all hands, including the captain, received certain shares\n",
      "of the profits called _lays_, and that these lays were proportioned to\n",
      "the degree of importance pertaining to the respective duties of the\n",
      "ship’s company. I was also aware that being a green hand at whaling, my\n",
      "own lay would not be very large; but considering that I was used to the\n",
      "sea, could steer a ship, splice a rope, and all that, I made no doubt\n",
      "that from all I had heard I should be offered at least the 275th\n",
      "lay—that is, the 275th part of the clear net proceeds of the voyage,\n",
      "whatever that might eventually amount to. And though the 275th lay was\n",
      "what they call a rather _long lay_, yet it was better than nothing; and\n",
      "if we had a lucky voyage, might pretty nearly pay for the clothing I\n",
      "would wear out on it, not to speak of my three years’ beef and board,\n",
      "for which I would not have to pay one stiver.\n",
      "\n",
      "It might be thought that this was a poor way to accumulate a princely\n",
      "fortune—and so it was, a very poor way indeed. But I am one of those\n",
      "that never take on about princely fortunes, and am quite content if the\n",
      "world is ready to board and lodge me, while I am putting up at this\n",
      "grim sign of the Thunder Cloud. Upon the whole, I thought that the\n",
      "275th lay would be about the fair thing, but would not have been\n",
      "surprised had I been offered the 200th, considering I was of a\n",
      "broad-shouldered make.\n",
      "\n",
      "But one thing, nevertheless, that made me a little distrustful about\n",
      "receiving a generous share of the profits was this: Ashore, I had heard\n",
      "something of both Captain Peleg and his unaccountable old crony Bildad;\n",
      "how that they being the principal proprietors of the Pequod, therefore\n",
      "the other and more inconsiderable and scattered owners, left nearly the\n",
      "whole management of the ship’s affairs to these two. And I did not know\n",
      "but what the stingy old Bildad might have a mighty deal to say about\n",
      "shipping hands, especially as I now found him on board the Pequod,\n",
      "quite at home there in the cabin, and reading his Bible as if at his\n",
      "own fireside. Now while Peleg was vainly trying to mend a pen with his\n",
      "jack-knife, old Bildad, to my no small surprise, considering that he\n",
      "was such an interested party in these proceedings; Bildad never heeded\n",
      "us, but went on mumbling to himself out of his book, “_Lay_ not up for\n",
      "yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, Captain Bildad,” interrupted Peleg, “what d’ye say, what lay\n",
      "shall we give this young man?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Thou knowest best,” was the sepulchral reply, “the seven hundred and\n",
      "seventy-seventh wouldn’t be too much, would it?—‘where moth and rust do\n",
      "corrupt, but _lay_—’”\n",
      "\n",
      "_Lay_, indeed, thought I, and such a lay! the seven hundred and\n",
      "seventy-seventh! Well, old Bildad, you are determined that I, for one,\n",
      "shall not _lay_ up many _lays_ here below, where moth and rust do\n",
      "corrupt. It was an exceedingly _long lay_ that, indeed; and though from\n",
      "the magnitude of the figure it might at first deceive a landsman, yet\n",
      "the slightest consideration will show that though seven hundred and\n",
      "seventy-seven is a pretty large number, yet, when you come to make a\n",
      "_teenth_ of it, you will then see, I say, that the seven hundred and\n",
      "seventy-seventh part of a farthing is a good deal less than seven\n",
      "hundred and seventy-seven gold doubloons; and so I thought at the time.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why, blast your eyes, Bildad,” cried Peleg, “thou dost not want to\n",
      "swindle this young man! he must have more than that.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Seven hundred and seventy-seventh,” again said Bildad, without lifting\n",
      "his eyes; and then went on mumbling—“for where your treasure is, there\n",
      "will your heart be also.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am going to put him down for the three hundredth,” said Peleg, “do\n",
      "ye hear that, Bildad! The three hundredth lay, I say.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Bildad laid down his book, and turning solemnly towards him said,\n",
      "“Captain Peleg, thou hast a generous heart; but thou must consider the\n",
      "duty thou owest to the other owners of this ship—widows and orphans,\n",
      "many of them—and that if we too abundantly reward the labors of this\n",
      "young man, we may be taking the bread from those widows and those\n",
      "orphans. The seven hundred and seventy-seventh lay, Captain Peleg.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Thou Bildad!” roared Peleg, starting up and clattering about the\n",
      "cabin. “Blast ye, Captain Bildad, if I had followed thy advice in these\n",
      "matters, I would afore now had a conscience to lug about that would be\n",
      "heavy enough to founder the largest ship that ever sailed round Cape\n",
      "Horn.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Captain Peleg,” said Bildad steadily, “thy conscience may be drawing\n",
      "ten inches of water, or ten fathoms, I can’t tell; but as thou art\n",
      "still an impenitent man, Captain Peleg, I greatly fear lest thy\n",
      "conscience be but a leaky one; and will in the end sink thee foundering\n",
      "down to the fiery pit, Captain Peleg.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Fiery pit! fiery pit! ye insult me, man; past all natural bearing, ye\n",
      "insult me. It’s an all-fired outrage to tell any human creature that\n",
      "he’s bound to hell. Flukes and flames! Bildad, say that again to me,\n",
      "and start my soul-bolts, but I’ll—I’ll—yes, I’ll swallow a live goat\n",
      "with all his hair and horns on. Out of the cabin, ye canting,\n",
      "drab-coloured son of a wooden gun—a straight wake with ye!”\n",
      "\n",
      "As he thundered out this he made a rush at Bildad, but with a\n",
      "marvellous oblique, sliding celerity, Bildad for that time eluded him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alarmed at this terrible outburst between the two principal and\n",
      "responsible owners of the ship, and feeling half a mind to give up all\n",
      "idea of sailing in a vessel so questionably owned and temporarily\n",
      "commanded, I stepped aside from the door to give egress to Bildad, who,\n",
      "I made no doubt, was all eagerness to vanish from before the awakened\n",
      "wrath of Peleg. But to my astonishment, he sat down again on the\n",
      "transom very quietly, and seemed to have not the slightest intention of\n",
      "withdrawing. He seemed quite used to impenitent Peleg and his ways. As\n",
      "for Peleg, after letting off his rage as he had, there seemed no more\n",
      "left in him, and he, too, sat down like a lamb, though he twitched a\n",
      "little as if still nervously agitated. “Whew!” he whistled at last—“the\n",
      "squall’s gone off to leeward, I think. Bildad, thou used to be good at\n",
      "sharpening a lance, mend that pen, will ye. My jack-knife here needs\n",
      "the grindstone. That’s he; thank ye, Bildad. Now then, my young man,\n",
      "Ishmael’s thy name, didn’t ye say? Well then, down ye go here, Ishmael,\n",
      "for the three hundredth lay.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Captain Peleg,” said I, “I have a friend with me who wants to ship\n",
      "too—shall I bring him down to-morrow?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“To be sure,” said Peleg. “Fetch him along, and we’ll look at him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What lay does he want?” groaned Bildad, glancing up from the book in\n",
      "which he had again been burying himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh! never thee mind about that, Bildad,” said Peleg. “Has he ever\n",

      "absurd notions about Yojo and his Ramadan;—but what of that? Queequeg\n",
      "thought he knew what he was about, I suppose; he seemed to be content;\n",

      "Queequeg! why don’t you speak? It’s I—Ishmael.” But all remained still\n",
      "as before. I began to grow alarmed. I had allowed him such abundant\n",

      "the key-hole; but the door opening into an odd corner of the room, the\n",
      "key-hole prospect was but a crooked and sinister one. I could only see\n",
      "part of the foot-board of the bed and a line of the wall, but nothing\n",
      "more. I was surprised to behold resting against the wall the wooden\n",
      "shaft of Queequeg’s harpoon, which the landlady the evening previous\n",

      "Mrs. Hussey soon appeared, with a mustard-pot in one hand and a\n",
      "vinegar-cruet in the other, having just broken away from the occupation\n",
      "of attending to the castors, and scolding her little black boy\n",
      "meantime.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wood-house!” cried I, “which way to it? Run for God’s sake, and fetch\n",

      "depend upon it!”—and so saying I was unmethodically rushing up stairs\n",

      "\n",
      "In as calm, but rapid a manner as possible, I gave her to understand\n",

      "her nose, she ruminated for an instant; then exclaimed—“No! I haven’t\n",
      "seen it since I put it there.” Running to a little closet under the\n",
      "landing of the stairs, she glanced in, and returning, told me that\n",

      "in the middle of the room; squatting on his hams, and holding Yojo on\n",

      "But all we said, not a word could we drag out of him; I almost felt\n",
      "like pushing him over, so as to change his position, for it was almost\n",
      "intolerable, it seemed so painfully and unnaturally constrained;\n",
      "especially, as in all probability he had been sitting so for upwards of\n",
      "eight or ten hours, going too without his regular meals.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mrs. Hussey,” said I, “he’s _alive_ at all events; so leave us, if you\n",
      "please, and I will see to this strange affair myself.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Closing the door upon the landlady, I endeavored to prevail upon\n",
      "Queequeg to take a chair; but in vain. There he sat; and all he could\n",
      "do—for all my polite arts and blandishments—he would not move a peg,\n",
      "nor say a single word, nor even look at me, nor notice my presence in\n",
      "the slightest way.\n",
      "\n",
      "I wonder, thought I, if this can possibly be a part of his Ramadan; do\n",
      "they fast on their hams that way in his native island. It must be so;\n",
      "yes, it’s part of his creed, I suppose; well, then, let him rest; he’ll\n",
      "get up sooner or later, no doubt. It can’t last for ever, thank God,\n",
      "and his Ramadan only comes once a year; and I don’t believe it’s very\n",
      "punctual then.\n",
      "\n",
      "I went down to supper. After sitting a long time listening to the long\n",
      "stories of some sailors who had just come from a plum-pudding voyage,\n",
      "as they called it (that is, a short whaling-voyage in a schooner or\n",
      "brig, confined to the north of the line, in the Atlantic Ocean only);\n",
      "after listening to these plum-puddingers till nearly eleven o’clock, I\n",
      "went up stairs to go to bed, feeling quite sure by this time Queequeg\n",
      "must certainly have brought his Ramadan to a termination. But no; there\n",
      "he was just where I had left him; he had not stirred an inch. I began\n",
      "to grow vexed with him; it seemed so downright senseless and insane to\n",
      "be sitting there all day and half the night on his hams in a cold room,\n",
      "holding a piece of wood on his head.\n",
      "\n",
      "“For heaven’s sake, Queequeg, get up and shake yourself; get up and\n",
      "have some supper. You’ll starve; you’ll kill yourself, Queequeg.” But\n",
      "not a word did he reply.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despairing of him, therefore, I determined to go to bed and to sleep;\n",
      "and no doubt, before a great while, he would follow me. But previous to\n",
      "turning in, I took my heavy bearskin jacket, and threw it over him, as\n",
      "it promised to be a very cold night; and he had nothing but his\n",
      "ordinary round jacket on. For some time, do all I would, I could not\n",
      "get into the faintest doze. I had blown out the candle; and the mere\n",
      "thought of Queequeg—not four feet off—sitting there in that uneasy\n",
      "position, stark alone in the cold and dark; this made me really\n",
      "wretched. Think of it; sleeping all night in the same room with a wide\n",
      "awake pagan on his hams in this dreary, unaccountable Ramadan!\n",
      "\n",
      "But somehow I dropped off at last, and knew nothing more till break of\n",
      "day; when, looking over the bedside, there squatted Queequeg, as if he\n",
      "had been screwed down to the floor. But as soon as the first glimpse of\n",
      "sun entered the window, up he got, with stiff and grating joints, but\n",
      "with a cheerful look; limped towards me where I lay; pressed his\n",
      "forehead again against mine; and said his Ramadan was over.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, as I before hinted, I have no objection to any person’s religion,\n",
      "be it what it may, so long as that person does not kill or insult any\n",
      "other person, because that other person don’t believe it also. But when\n",
      "a man’s religion becomes really frantic; when it is a positive torment\n",
      "to him; and, in fine, makes this earth of ours an uncomfortable inn to\n",
      "lodge in; then I think it high time to take that individual aside and\n",
      "argue the point with him.\n",
      "\n",
      "And just so I now did with Queequeg. “Queequeg,” said I, “get into bed\n",
      "now, and lie and listen to me.” I then went on, beginning with the rise\n",
      "and progress of the primitive religions, and coming down to the various\n",
      "religions of the present time, during which time I labored to show\n",
      "Queequeg that all these Lents, Ramadans, and prolonged ham-squattings\n",
      "in cold, cheerless rooms were stark nonsense; bad for the health;\n",
      "useless for the soul; opposed, in short, to the obvious laws of Hygiene\n",
      "and common sense. I told him, too, that he being in other things such\n",
      "an extremely sensible and sagacious savage, it pained me, very badly\n",
      "pained me, to see him now so deplorably foolish about this ridiculous\n",
      "Ramadan of his. Besides, argued I, fasting makes the body cave in;\n",
      "hence the spirit caves in; and all thoughts born of a fast must\n",
      "necessarily be half-starved. This is the reason why most dyspeptic\n",
      "religionists cherish such melancholy notions about their hereafters. In\n",
      "one word, Queequeg, said I, rather digressively; hell is an idea first\n",
      "born on an undigested apple-dumpling; and since then perpetuated\n",
      "through the hereditary dyspepsias nurtured by Ramadans.\n",
      "\n",
      "I then asked Queequeg whether he himself was ever troubled with\n",
      "dyspepsia; expressing the idea very plainly, so that he could take it\n",
      "in. He said no; only upon one memorable occasion. It was after a great\n",
      "feast given by his father the king, on the gaining of a great battle\n",
      "wherein fifty of the enemy had been killed by about two o’clock in the\n",
      "afternoon, and all cooked and eaten that very evening.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No more, Queequeg,” said I, shuddering; “that will do;” for I knew the\n",
      "inferences without his further hinting them. I had seen a sailor who\n",
      "had visited that very island, and he told me that it was the custom,\n",
      "when a great battle had been gained there, to barbecue all the slain in\n",
      "the yard or garden of the victor; and then, one by one, they were\n",
      "placed in great wooden trenchers, and garnished round like a pilau,\n",
      "with breadfruit and cocoanuts; and with some parsley in their mouths,\n",
      "were sent round with the victor’s compliments to all his friends, just\n",
      "as though these presents were so many Christmas turkeys.\n",
      "\n",
      "After all, I do not think that my remarks about religion made much\n",
      "impression upon Queequeg. Because, in the first place, he somehow\n",
      "seemed dull of hearing on that important subject, unless considered\n",
      "from his own point of view; and, in the second place, he did not more\n",
      "than one third understand me, couch my ideas simply as I would; and,\n",
      "finally, he no doubt thought he knew a good deal more about the true\n",
      "religion than I did. He looked at me with a sort of condescending\n",
      "concern and compassion, as though he thought it a great pity that such\n",
      "a sensible young man should be so hopelessly lost to evangelical pagan\n",
      "piety.\n",
      "\n",
      "At last we rose and dressed; and Queequeg, taking a prodigiously hearty\n",
      "breakfast of chowders of all sorts, so that the landlady should not\n",
      "make much profit by reason of his Ramadan, we sallied out to board the\n",

      "\n",
      "Struck by this plain matter-of-fact question, I answered, saying, “Yes,\n",

      "to the forecastle, we found the slide of the scuttle open. Seeing a\n",
      "light, we went down, and found only an old rigger there, wrapped in a\n",
      "tattered pea-jacket. He was thrown at whole length upon two chests, his\n",

      "would have thought myself to have been optically deceived in that\n",
      "matter, were it not for Elijah’s otherwise inexplicable question. But I\n",
      "beat the thing down; and again marking the sleeper, jocularly hinted to\n",
      "Queequeg that perhaps we had best sit up with the body; telling him to\n",
      "establish himself accordingly. He put his hand upon the sleeper’s rear,\n",
      "as though feeling if it was soft enough; and then, without more ado,\n",
      "sat quietly down there.\n",

      "\n",
      "Queequeg removed himself to just beyond the head of the sleeper, and\n",
      "lighted his tomahawk pipe. I sat at the feet. We kept the pipe passing\n",
      "over the sleeper, from one to the other. Meanwhile, upon questioning\n",
      "him in his broken fashion, Queequeg gave me to understand that, in his\n",
      "land, owing to the absence of settees and sofas of all sorts, the king,\n",
      "chiefs, and great people generally, were in the custom of fattening\n",
      "some of the lower orders for ottomans; and to furnish a house\n",
      "comfortably in that respect, you had only to buy up eight or ten lazy\n",
      "fellows, and lay them round in the piers and alcoves. Besides, it was\n",
      "very convenient on an excursion; much better than those garden-chairs\n",
      "which are convertible into walking-sticks; upon occasion, a chief\n",
      "calling his attendant, and desiring him to make a settee of himself\n",
      "under a spreading tree, perhaps in some damp marshy place.\n",
      "\n",
      "While narrating these things, every time Queequeg received the tomahawk\n",
      "from me, he flourished the hatchet-side of it over the sleeper’s head.\n",

      "He was going on with some wild reminiscences about his tomahawk-pipe,\n",
      "which, it seemed, had in its two uses both brained his foes and soothed\n",
      "his soul, when we were directly attracted to the sleeping rigger. The\n",
      "strong vapor now completely filling the contracted hole, it began to\n",
      "tell upon him. He breathed with a sort of muffledness; then seemed\n",
      "troubled in the nose; then revolved over once or twice; then sat up and\n",
      "rubbed his eyes.\n",

      "It was now clear sunrise. Soon the crew came on board in twos and\n",

      "\n",

      "How now! Here upon the very point of starting for the voyage, Captain\n",

      "well as to all appearances in port. And, as for Captain Ahab, no sign\n",
      "of him was yet to be seen; only, they said he was in the cabin. But\n",
      "then, the idea was, that his presence was by no means necessary in\n",
      "getting the ship under weigh, and steering her well out to sea. Indeed,\n",
      "as that was not at all his proper business, but the pilot’s; and as he\n",
      "was not yet completely recovered—so they said—therefore, Captain Ahab\n",
      "stayed below. And all this seemed natural enough; especially as in the\n",
      "merchant service many captains never show themselves on deck for a\n",
      "considerable time after heaving up the anchor, but remain over the\n",
      "cabin table, having a farewell merry-making with their shore friends,\n",
      "before they quit the ship for good with the pilot.\n",
      "\n",
      "But there was not much chance to think over the matter, for Captain\n",
      "Peleg was now all alive. He seemed to do most of the talking and\n",
      "commanding, and not Bildad.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Aft here, ye sons of bachelors,” he cried, as the sailors lingered at\n",
      "the main-mast. “Mr. Starbuck, drive ’em aft.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Strike the tent there!”—was the next order. As I hinted before, this\n",
      "whalebone marquee was never pitched except in port; and on board the\n",
      "Pequod, for thirty years, the order to strike the tent was well known\n",
      "to be the next thing to heaving up the anchor.\n",

      "“Man the capstan! Blood and thunder!—jump!”—was the next command, and\n",
      "the crew sprang for the handspikes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now in getting under weigh, the station generally occupied by the pilot\n",
      "is the forward part of the ship. And here Bildad, who, with Peleg, be\n",
      "it known, in addition to his other officers, was one of the licensed\n",
      "pilots of the port—he being suspected to have got himself made a pilot\n",
      "in order to save the Nantucket pilot-fee to all the ships he was\n",
      "concerned in, for he never piloted any other craft—Bildad, I say, might\n",
      "now be seen actively engaged in looking over the bows for the\n",
      "approaching anchor, and at intervals singing what seemed a dismal stave\n",
      "of psalmody, to cheer the hands at the windlass, who roared forth some\n",
      "sort of a chorus about the girls in Booble Alley, with hearty good\n",
      "will. Nevertheless, not three days previous, Bildad had told them that\n",
      "no profane songs would be allowed on board the Pequod, particularly in\n",
      "getting under weigh; and Charity, his sister, had placed a small choice\n",
      "copy of Watts in each seaman’s berth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meantime, overseeing the other part of the ship, Captain Peleg ripped\n",
      "and swore astern in the most frightful manner. I almost thought he\n",
      "would sink the ship before the anchor could be got up; involuntarily I\n",
      "paused on my handspike, and told Queequeg to do the same, thinking of\n",
      "the perils we both ran, in starting on the voyage with such a devil for\n",
      "a pilot. I was comforting myself, however, with the thought that in\n",
      "pious Bildad might be found some salvation, spite of his seven hundred\n",
      "and seventy-seventh lay; when I felt a sudden sharp poke in my rear,\n",
      "and turning round, was horrified at the apparition of Captain Peleg in\n",
      "the act of withdrawing his leg from my immediate vicinity. That was my\n",
      "first kick.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is that the way they heave in the marchant service?” he roared.\n",
      "“Spring, thou sheep-head; spring, and break thy backbone! Why don’t ye\n",
      "spring, I say, all of ye—spring! Quohog! spring, thou chap with the red\n",
      "whiskers; spring there, Scotch-cap; spring, thou green pants. Spring, I\n",
      "say, all of ye, and spring your eyes out!” And so saying, he moved\n",
      "along the windlass, here and there using his leg very freely, while\n",
      "imperturbable Bildad kept leading off with his psalmody. Thinks I,\n",
      "Captain Peleg must have been drinking something to-day.\n",
      "\n",
      "At last the anchor was up, the sails were set, and off we glided. It\n",

      "night, we found ourselves almost broad upon the wintry ocean, whose\n",
      "freezing spray cased us in ice, as in polished armor. The long rows of\n",

      "The chief mate of the Pequod was Starbuck, a native of Nantucket, and a\n",

      "icy coast, seemed well adapted to endure hot latitudes, his flesh being\n",
      "hard as twice-baked biscuit. Transported to the Indies, his live blood\n",
      "would not spoil like bottled ale. He must have been born in some time\n",

      "his state is famous. Only some thirty arid summers had he seen; those\n",
      "summers had dried up all his physical superfluousness. But this, his\n",

      "and cares, than it seemed the indication of any bodily blight. It was\n",
      "merely the condensation of the man. He was by no means ill-looking;\n",
      "quite the contrary. His pure tight skin was an excellent fit; and\n",
      "closely wrapped up in it, and embalmed with inner health and strength,\n",
      "like a revivified Egyptian, this Starbuck seemed prepared to endure for\n",
      "long ages to come, and to endure always, as now; for be it Polar snow\n",
      "or torrid sun, like a patent chronometer, his interior vitality was\n",
      "warranted to do well in all climates. Looking into his eyes, you seemed\n",
      "to see there the yet lingering images of those thousand-fold perils he\n",
      "had calmly confronted through life. A staid, steadfast man, whose life\n",
      "for the most part was a telling pantomime of action, and not a tame\n",
      "chapter of sounds. Yet, for all his hardy sobriety and fortitude, there\n",
      "were certain qualities in him which at times affected, and in some\n",
      "cases seemed well nigh to overbalance all the rest. Uncommonly\n",
      "conscientious for a seaman, and endued with a deep natural reverence,\n",
      "the wild watery loneliness of his life did therefore strongly incline\n",
      "him to superstition; but to that sort of superstition, which in some\n",
      "organizations seems rather to spring, somehow, from intelligence than\n",
      "from ignorance. Outward portents and inward presentiments were his. And\n",
      "if at times these things bent the welded iron of his soul, much more\n",
      "did his far-away domestic memories of his young Cape wife and child,\n",
      "tend to bend him still more from the original ruggedness of his nature,\n",
      "and open him still further to those latent influences which, in some\n",
      "honest-hearted men, restrain the gush of dare-devil daring, so often\n",
      "evinced by others in the more perilous vicissitudes of the fishery. “I\n",
      "will have no man in my boat,” said Starbuck, “who is not afraid of a\n",
      "whale.” By this, he seemed to mean, not only that the most reliable and\n",
      "useful courage was that which arises from the fair estimation of the\n",
      "encountered peril, but that an utterly fearless man is a far more\n",
      "dangerous comrade than a coward.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Aye, aye,” said Stubb, the second mate, “Starbuck, there, is as\n",

      "sentiment; but a thing simply useful to him, and always at hand upon\n",
      "all mortally practical occasions. Besides, he thought, perhaps, that in\n",
      "this business of whaling, courage was one of the great staple outfits\n",
      "of the ship, like her beef and her bread, and not to be foolishly\n",
      "wasted. Wherefore he had no fancy for lowering for whales after\n",
      "sun-down; nor for persisting in fighting a fish that too much persisted\n",
      "in fighting him. For, thought Starbuck, I am here in this critical\n",
      "ocean to kill whales for my living, and not to be killed by them for\n",
      "theirs; and that hundreds of men had been so killed Starbuck well knew.\n",

      "he find the torn limbs of his brother?\n",
      "\n",

      "superstitiousness, as has been said; the courage of this Starbuck which\n",
      "could, nevertheless, still flourish, must indeed have been extreme. But\n",
      "it was not in reasonable nature that a man so organized, and with such\n",
      "terrible experiences and remembrances as he had; it was not in nature\n",
      "that these things should fail in latently engendering an element in\n",
      "him, which, under suitable circumstances, would break out from its\n",
      "confinement, and burn all his courage up. And brave as he might be, it\n",
      "was that sort of bravery chiefly, visible in some intrepid men, which,\n",
      "while generally abiding firm in the conflict with seas, or winds, or\n",
      "whales, or any of the ordinary irrational horrors of the world, yet\n",
      "cannot withstand those more terrific, because more spiritual terrors,\n",

      "But were the coming narrative to reveal in any instance, the complete\n",

      "sort of call of the watch to tumble aloft, and bestir themselves there,\n",

      "not sooner.\n",

      "unfearing man, so cheerily trudging off with the burden of life in a\n",
      "world full of grave pedlars, all bowed to the ground with their packs;\n",
      "what helped to bring about that almost impious good-humor of his; that\n",
      "thing must have been his pipe. For, like his nose, his short, black\n",
      "little pipe was one of the regular features of his face. You would\n",

      "loaded, stuck in a rack, within easy reach of his hand; and, whenever\n",
      "he turned in, he smoked them all out in succession, lighting one from\n",
      "the other to the end of the chapter; then loading them again to be in\n",
      "readiness anew. For, when Stubb dressed, instead of first putting his\n",

      "miseries of the numberless mortals who have died exhaling it; and as in\n",
      "time of the cholera, some people go about with a camphorated\n",

      "The third mate was Flask, a native of Tisbury, in Martha’s Vineyard. A\n",
      "short, stout, ruddy young fellow, very pugnacious concerning whales,\n",

      "water-rat, requiring only a little circumvention and some small\n",
      "application of time and trouble in order to kill and boil. This\n",
      "ignorant, unconscious fearlessness of his made him a little waggish in\n",
      "the matter of whales; he followed these fish for the fun of it; and a\n",
      "three years’ voyage round Cape Horn was only a jolly joke that lasted\n",
      "that length of time. As a carpenter’s nails are divided into wrought\n",
      "nails and cut nails; so mankind may be similarly divided. Little Flask\n",
      "was one of the wrought ones; made to clinch tight and last long. They\n",

      "Captain Ahab would probably marshal his forces to descend on the\n",
      "whales, these three headsmen were as captains of companies. Or, being\n",
      "armed with their long keen whaling spears, they were as a picked trio\n",

      "\n",
      "And since in this famous fishery, each mate or headsman, like a Gothic\n",

      "who in certain conjunctures provides him with a fresh lance, when the\n",
      "former one has been badly twisted, or elbowed in the assault; and\n",
      "moreover, as there generally subsists between the two, a close intimacy\n",

      "Gay-Headers. Tashtego’s long, lean, sable hair, his high cheek bones,\n",
      "and black rounding eyes—for an Indian, Oriental in their largeness, but\n",
      "Antarctic in their glittering expression—all this sufficiently\n",

      "\n",
      "Third among the harpooneers was Daggoo, a gigantic, coal-black\n",
      "negro-savage, with a lion-like tread—an Ahasuerus to behold. Suspended\n",
      "from his ears were two golden hoops, so large that the sailors called\n",
      "them ring-bolts, and would talk of securing the top-sail halyards to\n",
      "them. In his youth Daggoo had voluntarily shipped on board of a whaler,\n",
      "lying in a lonely bay on his native coast. And never having been\n",
      "anywhere in the world but in Africa, Nantucket, and the pagan harbors\n",
      "most frequented by whalemen; and having now led for many years the bold\n",
      "life of the fishery in the ships of owners uncommonly heedful of what\n",
      "manner of men they shipped; Daggoo retained all his barbaric virtues,\n",
      "and erect as a giraffe, moved about the decks in all the pomp of six\n",
      "feet five in his socks. There was a corporeal humility in looking up at\n",
      "him; and a white man standing before him seemed a white flag come to\n",
      "beg truce of a fortress. Curious to tell, this imperial negro,\n",

      "\n",
      "For several days after leaving Nantucket, nothing above hatches was\n",
      "seen of Captain Ahab. The mates regularly relieved each other at the\n",
      "watches, and for aught that could be seen to the contrary, they seemed\n",
      "to be the only commanders of the ship; only they sometimes issued from\n",
      "the cabin with orders so sudden and peremptory, that after all it was\n",
      "plain they but commanded vicariously. Yes, their supreme lord and\n",
      "dictator was there, though hitherto unseen by any eyes not permitted to\n",
      "penetrate into the now sacred retreat of the cabin.\n",
      "\n",
      "Every time I ascended to the deck from my watches below, I instantly\n",
      "gazed aft to mark if any strange face were visible; for my first vague\n",
      "disquietude touching the unknown captain, now in the seclusion of the\n",
      "sea, became almost a perturbation. This was strangely heightened at\n",
      "times by the ragged Elijah’s diabolical incoherences uninvitedly\n",
      "recurring to me, with a subtle energy I could not have before conceived\n",
      "of. But poorly could I withstand them, much as in other moods I was\n",
      "almost ready to smile at the solemn whimsicalities of that outlandish\n",
      "prophet of the wharves. But whatever it was of apprehensiveness or\n",
      "uneasiness—to call it so—which I felt, yet whenever I came to look\n",
      "about me in the ship, it seemed against all warrantry to cherish such\n",
      "emotions. For though the harpooneers, with the great body of the crew,\n",
      "were a far more barbaric, heathenish, and motley set than any of the\n",
      "tame merchant-ship companies which my previous experiences had made me\n",
      "acquainted with, still I ascribed this—and rightly ascribed it—to the\n",
      "fierce uniqueness of the very nature of that wild Scandinavian vocation\n",
      "in which I had so abandonedly embarked. But it was especially the\n",
      "aspect of the three chief officers of the ship, the mates, which was\n",
      "most forcibly calculated to allay these colourless misgivings, and\n",
      "induce confidence and cheerfulness in every presentment of the voyage.\n",
      "Three better, more likely sea-officers and men, each in his own\n",
      "different way, could not readily be found, and they were every one of\n",
      "them Americans; a Nantucketer, a Vineyarder, a Cape man. Now, it being\n",
      "Christmas when the ship shot from out her harbor, for a space we had\n",
      "biting Polar weather, though all the time running away from it to the\n",
      "southward; and by every degree and minute of latitude which we sailed,\n",
      "gradually leaving that merciless winter, and all its intolerable\n",
      "weather behind us. It was one of those less lowering, but still grey\n",
      "and gloomy enough mornings of the transition, when with a fair wind the\n",
      "ship was rushing through the water with a vindictive sort of leaping\n",
      "and melancholy rapidity, that as I mounted to the deck at the call of\n",
      "the forenoon watch, so soon as I levelled my glance towards the\n",
      "taffrail, foreboding shivers ran over me. Reality outran apprehension;\n",
      "Captain Ahab stood upon his quarter-deck.\n",
      "\n",
      "There seemed no sign of common bodily illness about him, nor of the\n",
      "recovery from any. He looked like a man cut away from the stake, when\n",
      "the fire has overrunningly wasted all the limbs without consuming them,\n",
      "or taking away one particle from their compacted aged robustness. His\n",
      "whole high, broad form, seemed made of solid bronze, and shaped in an\n",
      "unalterable mould, like Cellini’s cast Perseus. Threading its way out\n",
      "from among his grey hairs, and continuing right down one side of his\n",
      "tawny scorched face and neck, till it disappeared in his clothing, you\n",
      "saw a slender rod-like mark, lividly whitish. It resembled that\n",
      "perpendicular seam sometimes made in the straight, lofty trunk of a\n",
      "great tree, when the upper lightning tearingly darts down it, and\n",
      "without wrenching a single twig, peels and grooves out the bark from\n",
      "top to bottom, ere running off into the soil, leaving the tree still\n",
      "greenly alive, but branded. Whether that mark was born with him, or\n",
      "whether it was the scar left by some desperate wound, no one could\n",
      "certainly say. By some tacit consent, throughout the voyage little or\n",
      "no allusion was made to it, especially by the mates. But once\n",
      "Tashtego’s senior, an old Gay-Head Indian among the crew,\n",
      "superstitiously asserted that not till he was full forty years old did\n",
      "Ahab become that way branded, and then it came upon him, not in the\n",
      "fury of any mortal fray, but in an elemental strife at sea. Yet, this\n",
      "wild hint seemed inferentially negatived, by what a grey Manxman\n",
      "insinuated, an old sepulchral man, who, having never before sailed out\n",
      "of Nantucket, had never ere this laid eye upon wild Ahab. Nevertheless,\n",
      "the old sea-traditions, the immemorial credulities, popularly invested\n",
      "this old Manxman with preternatural powers of discernment. So that no\n",
      "white sailor seriously contradicted him when he said that if ever\n",
      "Captain Ahab should be tranquilly laid out—which might hardly come to\n",
      "pass, so he muttered—then, whoever should do that last office for the\n",
      "dead, would find a birth-mark on him from crown to sole.\n",
      "\n",
      "So powerfully did the whole grim aspect of Ahab affect me, and the\n",
      "livid brand which streaked it, that for the first few moments I hardly\n",
      "noted that not a little of this overbearing grimness was owing to the\n",
      "barbaric white leg upon which he partly stood. It had previously come\n",
      "to me that this ivory leg had at sea been fashioned from the polished\n",
      "bone of the sperm whale’s jaw. “Aye, he was dismasted off Japan,” said\n",
      "the old Gay-Head Indian once; “but like his dismasted craft, he shipped\n",
      "another mast without coming home for it. He has a quiver of ’em.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I was struck with the singular posture he maintained. Upon each side of\n",
      "the Pequod’s quarter deck, and pretty close to the mizzen shrouds,\n",
      "there was an auger hole, bored about half an inch or so, into the\n",
      "plank. His bone leg steadied in that hole; one arm elevated, and\n",
      "holding by a shroud; Captain Ahab stood erect, looking straight out\n",
      "beyond the ship’s ever-pitching prow. There was an infinity of firmest\n",
      "fortitude, a determinate, unsurrenderable wilfulness, in the fixed and\n",
      "fearless, forward dedication of that glance. Not a word he spoke; nor\n",
      "did his officers say aught to him; though by all their minutest\n",
      "gestures and expressions, they plainly showed the uneasy, if not\n",
      "painful, consciousness of being under a troubled master-eye. And not\n",
      "only that, but moody stricken Ahab stood before them with a crucifixion\n",
      "in his face; in all the nameless regal overbearing dignity of some\n",
      "mighty woe.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ere long, from his first visit in the air, he withdrew into his cabin.\n",
      "But after that morning, he was every day visible to the crew; either\n",
      "standing in his pivot-hole, or seated upon an ivory stool he had; or\n",
      "heavily walking the deck. As the sky grew less gloomy; indeed, began to\n",
      "grow a little genial, he became still less and less a recluse; as if,\n",
      "when the ship had sailed from home, nothing but the dead wintry\n",
      "bleakness of the sea had then kept him so secluded. And, by and by, it\n",
      "came to pass, that he was almost continually in the air; but, as yet,\n",
      "for all that he said, or perceptibly did, on the at last sunny deck, he\n",
      "seemed as unnecessary there as another mast. But the Pequod was only\n",
      "making a passage now; not regularly cruising; nearly all whaling\n",
      "preparatives needing supervision the mates were fully competent to, so\n",
      "that there was little or nothing, out of himself, to employ or excite\n",
      "Ahab, now; and thus chase away, for that one interval, the clouds that\n",
      "layer upon layer were piled upon his brow, as ever all clouds choose\n",
      "the loftiest peaks to pile themselves upon.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nevertheless, ere long, the warm, warbling persuasiveness of the\n",
      "pleasant, holiday weather we came to, seemed gradually to charm him\n",
      "from his mood. For, as when the red-cheeked, dancing girls, April and\n",
      "May, trip home to the wintry, misanthropic woods; even the barest,\n",
      "ruggedest, most thunder-cloven old oak will at least send forth some\n",
      "few green sprouts, to welcome such glad-hearted visitants; so Ahab did,\n",
      "in the end, a little respond to the playful allurings of that girlish\n",
      "air. More than once did he put forth the faint blossom of a look,\n",
      "which, in any other man, would have soon flowered out in a smile.\n",

      "CHAPTER 29. Enter Ahab; to Him, Stubb.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some days elapsed, and ice and icebergs all astern, the Pequod now went\n",
      "rolling through the bright Quito spring, which, at sea, almost\n",
      "perpetually reigns on the threshold of the eternal August of the\n",
      "Tropic. The warmly cool, clear, ringing, perfumed, overflowing,\n",
      "redundant days, were as crystal goblets of Persian sherbet, heaped\n",
      "up—flaked up, with rose-water snow. The starred and stately nights\n",
      "seemed haughty dames in jewelled velvets, nursing at home in lonely\n",
      "pride, the memory of their absent conquering Earls, the golden helmeted\n",
      "suns! For sleeping man, ’twas hard to choose between such winsome days\n",
      "and such seducing nights. But all the witcheries of that unwaning\n",
      "weather did not merely lend new spells and potencies to the outward\n",
      "world. Inward they turned upon the soul, especially when the still mild\n",
      "hours of eve came on; then, memory shot her crystals as the clear ice\n",
      "most forms of noiseless twilights. And all these subtle agencies, more\n",
      "and more they wrought on Ahab’s texture.\n",
      "\n",
      "Old age is always wakeful; as if, the longer linked with life, the less\n",
      "man has to do with aught that looks like death. Among sea-commanders,\n",
      "the old greybeards will oftenest leave their berths to visit the\n",
      "night-cloaked deck. It was so with Ahab; only that now, of late, he\n",
      "seemed so much to live in the open air, that truly speaking, his visits\n",
      "were more to the cabin, than from the cabin to the planks. “It feels\n",
      "like going down into one’s tomb,”—he would mutter to himself—“for an\n",

      "grave-dug berth.”\n",

      "So, almost every twenty-four hours, when the watches of the night were\n",

      "and when if a rope was to be hauled upon the forecastle, the sailors\n",
      "flung it not rudely down, as by day, but with some cautiousness dropt\n",
      "it to its place for fear of disturbing their slumbering shipmates; when\n",
      "this sort of steady quietude would begin to prevail, habitually, the\n",
      "silent steersman would watch the cabin-scuttle; and ere long the old\n",
      "man would emerge, gripping at the iron banister, to help his crippled\n",

      "these, he usually abstained from patrolling the quarter-deck; because\n",
      "to his wearied mates, seeking repose within six inches of his ivory\n",
      "heel, such would have been the reverberating crack and din of that bony\n",
      "step, that their dreams would have been on the crunching teeth of\n",

      "nay; but there might be some way of muffling the noise; hinting\n",
      "something indistinctly and hesitatingly about a globe of tow, and the\n",

      "whales with these visible hands; I am in earnest; and I will try. There\n",
      "are some preliminaries to settle.\n",
      "\n",
      "First: The uncertain, unsettled condition of this science of Cetology\n",
      "is in the very vestibule attested by the fact, that in some quarters it\n",
      "still remains a moot point whether a whale be a fish. In his System of\n",
      "Nature, A.D. 1776, Linnæus declares, “I hereby separate the whales from\n",
      "the fish.” But of my own knowledge, I know that down to the year 1850,\n",
      "sharks and shad, alewives and herring, against Linnæus’s express edict,\n",
      "were still found dividing the possession of the same seas with the\n",
      "Leviathan.\n",
      "\n",
      "The grounds upon which Linnæus would fain have banished the whales from\n",
      "the waters, he states as follows: “On account of their warm bilocular\n",
      "heart, their lungs, their movable eyelids, their hollow ears, penem\n",
      "intrantem feminam mammis lactantem,” and finally, “ex lege naturæ jure\n",
      "meritoque.” I submitted all this to my friends Simeon Macey and Charley\n",
      "Coffin, of Nantucket, both messmates of mine in a certain voyage, and\n",
      "they united in the opinion that the reasons set forth were altogether\n",
      "insufficient. Charley profanely hinted they were humbug.\n",
      "\n",
      "Be it known that, waiving all argument, I take the good old fashioned\n",
      "ground that the whale is a fish, and call upon holy Jonah to back me.\n",
      "This fundamental thing settled, the next point is, in what internal\n",
      "respect does the whale differ from other fish. Above, Linnæus has given\n",
      "you those items. But in brief, they are these: lungs and warm blood;\n",
      "whereas, all other fish are lungless and cold blooded.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next: how shall we define the whale, by his obvious externals, so as\n",
      "conspicuously to label him for all time to come? To be short, then, a\n",
      "whale is _a spouting fish with a horizontal tail_. There you have him.\n",
      "However contracted, that definition is the result of expanded\n",
      "meditation. A walrus spouts much like a whale, but the walrus is not a\n",
      "fish, because he is amphibious. But the last term of the definition is\n",
      "still more cogent, as coupled with the first. Almost any one must have\n",
      "noticed that all the fish familiar to landsmen have not a flat, but a\n",
      "vertical, or up-and-down tail. Whereas, among spouting fish the tail,\n",
      "though it may be similarly shaped, invariably assumes a horizontal\n",
      "position.\n",
      "\n",
      "By the above definition of what a whale is, I do by no means exclude\n",
      "from the leviathanic brotherhood any sea creature hitherto identified\n",
      "with the whale by the best informed Nantucketers; nor, on the other\n",
      "hand, link with it any fish hitherto authoritatively regarded as\n",
      "alien.* Hence, all the smaller, spouting, and horizontal tailed fish\n",
      "must be included in this ground-plan of Cetology. Now, then, come the\n",
      "grand divisions of the entire whale host.\n",
      "\n",
      "*I am aware that down to the present time, the fish styled Lamatins and\n",
      "Dugongs (Pig-fish and Sow-fish of the Coffins of Nantucket) are\n",
      "included by many naturalists among the whales. But as these pig-fish\n",
      "are a noisy, contemptible set, mostly lurking in the mouths of rivers,\n",
      "and feeding on wet hay, and especially as they do not spout, I deny\n",

      "whose distant jet is so often descried by passengers crossing the\n",

      "part of the back, of an angular shape, and with a very sharp pointed\n",
      "end. Even if not the slightest other part of the creature be visible,\n",

      "The large importance attached to the harpooneer’s vocation is evinced\n",
      "by the fact, that originally in the old Dutch Fishery, two centuries\n",
      "and more ago, the command of a whale ship was not wholly lodged in the\n",
      "person now called the captain, but was divided between him and an\n",
      "officer called the Specksnyder. Literally this word means Fat-Cutter;\n",
      "usage, however, in time made it equivalent to Chief Harpooneer. In\n",
      "those days, the captain’s authority was restricted to the navigation\n",
      "and general management of the vessel; while over the whale-hunting\n",
      "department and all its concerns, the Specksnyder or Chief Harpooneer\n",
      "reigned supreme. In the British Greenland Fishery, under the corrupted\n",
      "title of Specksioneer, this old Dutch official is still retained, but\n",
      "his former dignity is sadly abridged. At present he ranks simply as\n",
      "senior Harpooneer; and as such, is but one of the captain’s more\n",
      "inferior subalterns. Nevertheless, as upon the good conduct of the\n",
      "harpooneers the success of a whaling voyage largely depends, and since\n",
      "in the American Fishery he is not only an important officer in the\n",
      "boat, but under certain circumstances (night watches on a whaling\n",
      "ground) the command of the ship’s deck is also his; therefore the grand\n",
      "political maxim of the sea demands, that he should nominally live apart\n",
      "from the men before the mast, and be in some way distinguished as their\n",
      "professional superior; though always, by them, familiarly regarded as\n",
      "their social equal.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, the grand distinction drawn between officer and man at sea, is\n",
      "this—the first lives aft, the last forward. Hence, in whale-ships and\n",
      "merchantmen alike, the mates have their quarters with the captain; and\n",
      "so, too, in most of the American whalers the harpooneers are lodged in\n",
      "the after part of the ship. That is to say, they take their meals in\n",
      "the captain’s cabin, and sleep in a place indirectly communicating with\n",
      "it.\n",

      "of all voyages now or ever made by man), the peculiar perils of it, and\n",
      "the community of interest prevailing among a company, all of whom, high\n",
      "or low, depend for their profits, not upon fixed wages, but upon their\n",
      "common luck, together with their common vigilance, intrepidity, and\n",
      "hard work; though all these things do in some cases tend to beget a\n",
      "less rigorous discipline than in merchantmen generally; yet, never mind\n",

      "it will, it can never assume the practical, available supremacy over\n",
      "other men, without the aid of some sort of external arts and\n",
      "entrenchments, always, in themselves, more or less paltry and base.\n",
      "This it is, that for ever keeps God’s true princes of the Empire from\n",

      "\n",
      "It is noon; and Dough-Boy, the steward, thrusting his pale\n",
      "loaf-of-bread face from the cabin-scuttle, announces dinner to his lord\n",
      "and master; who, sitting in the lee quarter-boat, has just been taking\n",
      "an observation of the sun; and is now mutely reckoning the latitude on\n",
      "the smooth, medallion-shaped tablet, reserved for that daily purpose on\n",
      "the upper part of his ivory leg. From his complete inattention to the\n",
      "tidings, you would think that moody Ahab had not heard his menial. But\n",
      "presently, catching hold of the mizen shrouds, he swings himself to the\n",
      "deck, and in an even, unexhilarated voice, saying, “Dinner, Mr.\n",
      "Starbuck,” disappears into the cabin.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the last echo of his sultan’s step has died away, and Starbuck,\n",
      "the first Emir, has every reason to suppose that he is seated, then\n",
      "Starbuck rouses from his quietude, takes a few turns along the planks,\n",
      "and, after a grave peep into the binnacle, says, with some touch of\n",
      "pleasantness, “Dinner, Mr. Stubb,” and descends the scuttle. The second\n",
      "Emir lounges about the rigging awhile, and then slightly shaking the\n",
      "main brace, to see whether it will be all right with that important\n",
      "rope, he likewise takes up the old burden, and with a rapid “Dinner,\n",
      "Mr. Flask,” follows after his predecessors.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the third Emir, now seeing himself all alone on the quarter-deck,\n",
      "seems to feel relieved from some curious restraint; for, tipping all\n",
      "sorts of knowing winks in all sorts of directions, and kicking off his\n",
      "shoes, he strikes into a sharp but noiseless squall of a hornpipe right\n",
      "over the Grand Turk’s head; and then, by a dexterous sleight, pitching\n",
      "his cap up into the mizentop for a shelf, he goes down rollicking so\n",
      "far at least as he remains visible from the deck, reversing all other\n",
      "processions, by bringing up the rear with music. But ere stepping into\n",
      "the cabin doorway below, he pauses, ships a new face altogether, and,\n",
      "then, independent, hilarious little Flask enters King Ahab’s presence,\n",
      "in the character of Abjectus, or the Slave.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is not the least among the strange things bred by the intense\n",
      "artificialness of sea-usages, that while in the open air of the deck\n",
      "some officers will, upon provocation, bear themselves boldly and\n",
      "defyingly enough towards their commander; yet, ten to one, let those\n",
      "very officers the next moment go down to their customary dinner in that\n",

      "deprecatory and humble air towards him, as he sits at the head of the\n",
      "table; this is marvellous, sometimes most comical. Wherefore this\n",
      "difference? A problem? Perhaps not. To have been Belshazzar, King of\n",
      "Babylon; and to have been Belshazzar, not haughtily but courteously,\n",
      "therein certainly must have been some touch of mundane grandeur. But he\n",
      "who in the rightly regal and intelligent spirit presides over his own\n",
      "private dinner-table of invited guests, that man’s unchallenged power\n",
      "and dominion of individual influence for the time; that man’s royalty\n",
      "of state transcends Belshazzar’s, for Belshazzar was not the greatest.\n",
      "Who has but once dined his friends, has tasted what it is to be Cæsar.\n",
      "It is a witchery of social czarship which there is no withstanding.\n",
      "Now, if to this consideration you superadd the official supremacy of a\n",
      "ship-master, then, by inference, you will derive the cause of that\n",
      "peculiarity of sea-life just mentioned.\n",
      "\n",
      "Over his ivory-inlaid table, Ahab presided like a mute, maned sea-lion\n",
      "on the white coral beach, surrounded by his warlike but still\n",
      "deferential cubs. In his own proper turn, each officer waited to be\n",
      "served. They were as little children before Ahab; and yet, in Ahab,\n",
      "there seemed not to lurk the smallest social arrogance. With one mind,\n",
      "their intent eyes all fastened upon the old man’s knife, as he carved\n",
      "the chief dish before him. I do not suppose that for the world they\n",
      "would have profaned that moment with the slightest observation, even\n",
      "upon so neutral a topic as the weather. No! And when reaching out his\n",
      "knife and fork, between which the slice of beef was locked, Ahab\n",
      "thereby motioned Starbuck’s plate towards him, the mate received his\n",
      "meat as though receiving alms; and cut it tenderly; and a little\n",
      "started if, perchance, the knife grazed against the plate; and chewed\n",
      "it noiselessly; and swallowed it, not without circumspection. For, like\n",
      "the Coronation banquet at Frankfort, where the German Emperor\n",
      "profoundly dines with the seven Imperial Electors, so these cabin meals\n",
      "were somehow solemn meals, eaten in awful silence; and yet at table old\n",
      "Ahab forbade not conversation; only he himself was dumb. What a relief\n",
      "it was to choking Stubb, when a rat made a sudden racket in the hold\n",
      "below. And poor little Flask, he was the youngest son, and little boy\n",
      "of this weary family party. His were the shinbones of the saline beef;\n",
      "his would have been the drumsticks. For Flask to have presumed to help\n",
      "himself, this must have seemed to him tantamount to larceny in the\n",
      "first degree. Had he helped himself at that table, doubtless, never\n",
      "more would he have been able to hold his head up in this honest world;\n",
      "nevertheless, strange to say, Ahab never forbade him. And had Flask\n",
      "helped himself, the chances were Ahab had never so much as noticed it.\n",
      "Least of all, did Flask presume to help himself to butter. Whether he\n",
      "thought the owners of the ship denied it to him, on account of its\n",
      "clotting his clear, sunny complexion; or whether he deemed that, on so\n",
      "long a voyage in such marketless waters, butter was at a premium, and\n",
      "therefore was not for him, a subaltern; however it was, Flask, alas!\n",
      "was a butterless man!\n",
      "\n",
      "Another thing. Flask was the last person down at the dinner, and Flask\n",
      "is the first man up. Consider! For hereby Flask’s dinner was badly\n",
      "jammed in point of time. Starbuck and Stubb both had the start of him;\n",
      "and yet they also have the privilege of lounging in the rear. If Stubb\n",
      "even, who is but a peg higher than Flask, happens to have but a small\n",
      "appetite, and soon shows symptoms of concluding his repast, then Flask\n",
      "must bestir himself, he will not get more than three mouthfuls that\n",
      "day; for it is against holy usage for Stubb to precede Flask to the\n",
      "deck. Therefore it was that Flask once admitted in private, that ever\n",
      "since he had arisen to the dignity of an officer, from that moment he\n",
      "had never known what it was to be otherwise than hungry, more or less.\n",
      "For what he ate did not so much relieve his hunger, as keep it immortal\n",
      "in him. Peace and satisfaction, thought Flask, have for ever departed\n",
      "from my stomach. I am an officer; but, how I wish I could fish a bit of\n",
      "old-fashioned beef in the forecastle, as I used to when I was before\n",
      "the mast. There’s the fruits of promotion now; there’s the vanity of\n",
      "glory: there’s the insanity of life! Besides, if it were so that any\n",
      "mere sailor of the Pequod had a grudge against Flask in Flask’s\n",
      "official capacity, all that sailor had to do, in order to obtain ample\n",
      "vengeance, was to go aft at dinner-time, and get a peep at Flask\n",
      "through the cabin sky-light, sitting silly and dumfoundered before\n",
      "awful Ahab.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, Ahab and his three mates formed what may be called the first table\n",
      "in the Pequod’s cabin. After their departure, taking place in inverted\n",
      "order to their arrival, the canvas cloth was cleared, or rather was\n",
      "restored to some hurried order by the pallid steward. And then the\n",
      "three harpooneers were bidden to the feast, they being its residuary\n",
      "legatees. They made a sort of temporary servants’ hall of the high and\n",
      "mighty cabin.\n",
      "\n",
      "In strange contrast to the hardly tolerable constraint and nameless\n",
      "invisible domineerings of the captain’s table, was the entire care-free\n",
      "license and ease, the almost frantic democracy of those inferior\n",
      "fellows the harpooneers. While their masters, the mates, seemed afraid\n",
      "of the sound of the hinges of their own jaws, the harpooneers chewed\n",
      "their food with such a relish that there was a report to it. They dined\n",
      "like lords; they filled their bellies like Indian ships all day loading\n",
      "with spices. Such portentous appetites had Queequeg and Tashtego, that\n",
      "to fill out the vacancies made by the previous repast, often the pale\n",
      "Dough-Boy was fain to bring on a great baron of salt-junk, seemingly\n",
      "quarried out of the solid ox. And if he were not lively about it, if he\n",
      "did not go with a nimble hop-skip-and-jump, then Tashtego had an\n",
      "ungentlemanly way of accelerating him by darting a fork at his back,\n",
      "harpoon-wise. And once Daggoo, seized with a sudden humor, assisted\n",
      "Dough-Boy’s memory by snatching him up bodily, and thrusting his head\n",
      "into a great empty wooden trencher, while Tashtego, knife in hand,\n",
      "began laying out the circle preliminary to scalping him. He was\n",
      "naturally a very nervous, shuddering sort of little fellow, this\n",
      "bread-faced steward; the progeny of a bankrupt baker and a hospital\n",
      "nurse. And what with the standing spectacle of the black terrific Ahab,\n",
      "and the periodical tumultuous visitations of these three savages,\n",
      "Dough-Boy’s whole life was one continual lip-quiver. Commonly, after\n",
      "seeing the harpooneers furnished with all things they demanded, he\n",
      "would escape from their clutches into his little pantry adjoining, and\n",
      "fearfully peep out at them through the blinds of its door, till all was\n",
      "over.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a sight to see Queequeg seated over against Tashtego, opposing\n",
      "his filed teeth to the Indian’s: crosswise to them, Daggoo seated on\n",
      "the floor, for a bench would have brought his hearse-plumed head to the\n",
      "low carlines; at every motion of his colossal limbs, making the low\n",
      "cabin framework to shake, as when an African elephant goes passenger in\n",
      "a ship. But for all this, the great negro was wonderfully abstemious,\n",
      "not to say dainty. It seemed hardly possible that by such comparatively\n",
      "small mouthfuls he could keep up the vitality diffused through so\n",
      "broad, baronial, and superb a person. But, doubtless, this noble savage\n",
      "fed strong and drank deep of the abounding element of air; and through\n",
      "his dilated nostrils snuffed in the sublime life of the worlds. Not by\n",
      "beef or by bread, are giants made or nourished. But Queequeg, he had a\n",
      "mortal, barbaric smack of the lip in eating—an ugly sound enough—so\n",
      "much so, that the trembling Dough-Boy almost looked to see whether any\n",
      "marks of teeth lurked in his own lean arms. And when he would hear\n",
      "Tashtego singing out for him to produce himself, that his bones might\n",
      "be picked, the simple-witted steward all but shattered the crockery\n",
      "hanging round him in the pantry, by his sudden fits of the palsy. Nor\n",
      "did the whetstone which the harpooneers carried in their pockets, for\n",
      "their lances and other weapons; and with which whetstones, at dinner,\n",
      "they would ostentatiously sharpen their knives; that grating sound did\n",
      "not at all tend to tranquillize poor Dough-Boy. How could he forget\n",
      "that in his Island days, Queequeg, for one, must certainly have been\n",
      "guilty of some murderous, convivial indiscretions. Alas! Dough-Boy!\n",
      "hard fares the white waiter who waits upon cannibals. Not a napkin\n",
      "should he carry on his arm, but a buckler. In good time, though, to his\n",
      "great delight, the three salt-sea warriors would rise and depart; to\n",
      "his credulous, fable-mongering ears, all their martial bones jingling\n",
      "in them at every step, like Moorish scimetars in scabbards.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, though these barbarians dined in the cabin, and nominally lived\n",
      "there; still, being anything but sedentary in their habits, they were\n",

      "In this one matter, Ahab seemed no exception to most American whale\n",

      "anybody else is, at any time, permitted there. So that, in real truth,\n",
      "the mates and harpooneers of the Pequod might more properly be said to\n",
      "have lived out of the cabin than in it. For when they did enter it, it\n",
      "was something as a street-door enters a house; turning inwards for a\n",
      "moment, only to be turned out the next; and, as a permanent thing,\n",
      "residing in the open air. Nor did they lose much hereby; in the cabin\n",
      "was no companionship; socially, Ahab was inaccessible. Though nominally\n",
      "included in the census of Christendom, he was still an alien to it. He\n",
      "lived in the world, as the last of the Grisly Bears lived in settled\n",
      "Missouri. And as when Spring and Summer had departed, that wild Logan\n",
      "of the woods, burying himself in the hollow of a tree, lived out the\n",
      "winter there, sucking his own paws; so, in his inclement, howling old\n",
      "age, Ahab’s soul, shut up in the caved trunk of his body, there fed\n",
      "upon the sullen paws of its gloom!\n",

      "CHAPTER 35. The Mast-Head.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was during the more pleasant weather, that in due rotation with the\n",
      "other seamen my first mast-head came round.\n",
      "\n",
      "In most American whalemen the mast-heads are manned almost\n",
      "simultaneously with the vessel’s leaving her port; even though she may\n",
      "have fifteen thousand miles, and more, to sail ere reaching her proper\n",
      "cruising ground. And if, after a three, four, or five years’ voyage she\n",
      "is drawing nigh home with anything empty in her—say, an empty vial\n",
      "even—then, her mast-heads are kept manned to the last; and not till her\n",
      "skysail-poles sail in among the spires of the port, does she altogether\n",
      "relinquish the hope of capturing one whale more.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, as the business of standing mast-heads, ashore or afloat, is a\n",
      "very ancient and interesting one, let us in some measure expatiate\n",
      "here. I take it, that the earliest standers of mast-heads were the old\n",
      "Egyptians; because, in all my researches, I find none prior to them.\n",
      "For though their progenitors, the builders of Babel, must doubtless, by\n",
      "their tower, have intended to rear the loftiest mast-head in all Asia,\n",
      "or Africa either; yet (ere the final truck was put to it) as that great\n",
      "stone mast of theirs may be said to have gone by the board, in the\n",
      "dread gale of God’s wrath; therefore, we cannot give these Babel\n",
      "builders priority over the Egyptians. And that the Egyptians were a\n",
      "nation of mast-head standers, is an assertion based upon the general\n",
      "belief among archæologists, that the first pyramids were founded for\n",
      "astronomical purposes: a theory singularly supported by the peculiar\n",
      "stair-like formation of all four sides of those edifices; whereby, with\n",
      "prodigious long upliftings of their legs, those old astronomers were\n",
      "wont to mount to the apex, and sing out for new stars; even as the\n",
      "look-outs of a modern ship sing out for a sail, or a whale just bearing\n",
      "in sight. In Saint Stylites, the famous Christian hermit of old times,\n",
      "who built him a lofty stone pillar in the desert and spent the whole\n",
      "latter portion of his life on its summit, hoisting his food from the\n",

      "And as if the now tested reality of his might had in former legendary\n",

      "so incredibly ferocious as continually to be athirst for human blood.\n",
      "Nor even down to so late a time as Cuvier’s, were these or almost\n",

      "It is a thing well known to both American and English whale-ships, and\n",

      "that some whales have been captured far north in the Pacific, in whose\n",
      "bodies have been found the barbs of harpoons darted in the Greenland\n",

      "problem to man, was never a problem to the whale. So that here, in the\n",

      "should go still further in their superstitions; declaring Moby Dick not\n",
      "only ubiquitous, but immortal (for immortality is but ubiquity in\n",
      "time); that though groves of spears should be planted in his flanks, he\n",
      "would still swim away unharmed; or if indeed he should ever be made to\n",
      "spout thick blood, such a sight would be but a ghastly deception; for\n",

      "stormed his general sanity, and carried it, and turned all its\n",
      "concentred cannon upon its own mad mark; so that far from having lost\n",

      "Aside from those more obvious considerations touching Moby Dick, which\n",
      "could not but occasionally awaken in any man’s soul some alarm, there\n",

      "above all their other magniloquent ascriptions of dominion; and the\n",

      "\n",
      "First: In the year 1820 the ship Essex, Captain Pollard, of Nantucket,\n",
      "was cruising in the Pacific Ocean. One day she saw spouts, lowered her\n",
      "boats, and gave chase to a shoal of sperm whales. Ere long, several of\n",
      "the whales were wounded; when, suddenly, a very large whale escaping\n",

      "surviving plank of her has been seen since. After the severest\n",
      "exposure, part of the crew reached the land in their boats. Being\n",
      "returned home at last, Captain Pollard once more sailed for the Pacific\n",

      "Owen Chace, who was chief mate of the Essex at the time of the tragedy;\n",
      "I have read his plain and faithful narrative; I have conversed with his\n",

      "*The following are extracts from Chace’s narrative: “Every fact seemed\n",

      "a short interval between them, both of which, according to their\n",
      "direction, were calculated to do us the most injury, by being made\n",
      "ahead, and thereby combining the speed of the two objects for the\n",
      "shock; to effect which, the exact manœuvres which he made were\n",
      "necessary. His aspect was most horrible, and such as indicated\n",
      "resentment and fury. He came directly from the shoal which we had just\n",

      "were, like the air over intensely heated plates of iron. Beneath this\n",
      "atmospheric waving and curling, and partially beneath a thin layer of\n",
      "water, also, the whales were swimming. Seen in advance of all the other\n",

      "in these jaws of death! In vain we hailed the other boats; as well roar\n",
      "to the live coals down the chimney of a flaming furnace as hail those\n",

      "darker with the shadows of night; no sign of the ship could be seen.\n",
      "The rising sea forbade all attempts to bale out the boat. The oars were\n",

      "standard-bearer of this forlorn hope. There, then, he sat, holding up\n",

      "his gay banterings.\n",
      "\n",
      "“‘Aye, aye, my merry lads, it’s a lively leak this; hold a cannikin,\n",
      "one of ye, and let’s have a taste. By the Lord, it’s worth bottling! I\n",
      "tell ye what, men, old Rad’s investment must go for it! he had best cut\n",
      "away his part of the hull and tow it home. The fact is, boys, that\n",
      "sword-fish only began the job; he’s come back again with a gang of\n",
      "ship-carpenters, saw-fish, and file-fish, and what not; and the whole\n",

      "making improvements, I suppose. If old Rad were here now, I’d tell him\n",
      "to jump overboard and scatter ’em. They’re playing the devil with his\n",
      "estate, I can tell him. But he’s a simple old soul,—Rad, and a beauty\n",
      "too. Boys, they say the rest of his property is invested in\n",

      "lively, now!’ And with that the pump clanged like fifty fire-engines;\n",
      "the men tossed their hats off to it, and ere long that peculiar gasping\n",
      "of the lungs was heard which denotes the fullest tension of life’s\n",
      "utmost energies.\n",

      "“Quitting the pump at last, with the rest of his band, the Lakeman went\n",
      "forward all panting, and sat himself down on the windlass; his face\n",
      "fiery red, his eyes bloodshot, and wiping the profuse sweat from his\n",
      "brow. Now what cozening fiend it was, gentlemen, that possessed Radney\n",
      "to meddle with such a man in that corporeally exasperated state, I know\n",
      "not; but so it happened. Intolerably striding along the deck, the mate\n",
      "commanded him to get a broom and sweep down the planks, and also a\n",
      "shovel, and remove some offensive matters consequent upon allowing a\n",
      "pig to run at large.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now, gentlemen, sweeping a ship’s deck at sea is a piece of household\n",
      "work which in all times but raging gales is regularly attended to every\n",
      "evening; it has been known to be done in the case of ships actually\n",
      "foundering at the time. Such, gentlemen, is the inflexibility of\n",
      "sea-usages and the instinctive love of neatness in seamen; some of whom\n",
      "would not willingly drown without first washing their faces. But in all\n",
      "vessels this broom business is the prescriptive province of the boys,\n",
      "if boys there be aboard. Besides, it was the stronger men in the\n",
      "Town-Ho that had been divided into gangs, taking turns at the pumps;\n",
      "and being the most athletic seaman of them all, Steelkilt had been\n",
      "regularly assigned captain of one of the gangs; consequently he should\n",
      "have been freed from any trivial business not connected with truly\n",
      "nautical duties, such being the case with his comrades. I mention all\n",
      "these particulars so that you may understand exactly how this affair\n",
      "stood between the two men.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But there was more than this: the order about the shovel was almost as\n",
      "plainly meant to sting and insult Steelkilt, as though Radney had spat\n",
      "in his face. Any man who has gone sailor in a whale-ship will\n",
      "understand this; and all this and doubtless much more, the Lakeman\n",
      "fully comprehended when the mate uttered his command. But as he sat\n",
      "still for a moment, and as he steadfastly looked into the mate’s\n",
      "malignant eye and perceived the stacks of powder-casks heaped up in him\n",
      "and the slow-match silently burning along towards them; as he\n",
      "instinctively saw all this, that strange forbearance and unwillingness\n",
      "to stir up the deeper passionateness in any already ireful being—a\n",
      "repugnance most felt, when felt at all, by really valiant men even when\n",
      "aggrieved—this nameless phantom feeling, gentlemen, stole over\n",
      "Steelkilt.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Therefore, in his ordinary tone, only a little broken by the bodily\n",
      "exhaustion he was temporarily in, he answered him saying that sweeping\n",
      "the deck was not his business, and he would not do it. And then,\n",
      "without at all alluding to the shovel, he pointed to three lads as the\n",
      "customary sweepers; who, not being billeted at the pumps, had done\n",
      "little or nothing all day. To this, Radney replied with an oath, in a\n",
      "most domineering and outrageous manner unconditionally reiterating his\n",
      "command; meanwhile advancing upon the still seated Lakeman, with an\n",

      "“Heated and irritated as he was by his spasmodic toil at the pumps, for\n",
      "all his first nameless feeling of forbearance the sweating Steelkilt\n",
      "could but ill brook this bearing in the mate; but somehow still\n",
      "smothering the conflagration within him, without speaking he remained\n",
      "doggedly rooted to his seat, till at last the incensed Radney shook the\n",
      "hammer within a few inches of his face, furiously commanding him to do\n",
      "his bidding.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Steelkilt rose, and slowly retreating round the windlass, steadily\n",
      "followed by the mate with his menacing hammer, deliberately repeated\n",
      "his intention not to obey. Seeing, however, that his forbearance had\n",
      "not the slightest effect, by an awful and unspeakable intimation with\n",
      "his twisted hand he warned off the foolish and infatuated man; but it\n",
      "was to no purpose. And in this way the two went once slowly round the\n",
      "windlass; when, resolved at last no longer to retreat, bethinking him\n",
      "that he had now forborne as much as comported with his humor, the\n",
      "Lakeman paused on the hatches and thus spoke to the officer:\n",
      "\n",
      "“‘Mr. Radney, I will not obey you. Take that hammer away, or look to\n",
      "yourself.’ But the predestinated mate coming still closer to him, where\n",
      "the Lakeman stood fixed, now shook the heavy hammer within an inch of\n",
      "his teeth; meanwhile repeating a string of insufferable maledictions.\n",
      "Retreating not the thousandth part of an inch; stabbing him in the eye\n",
      "with the unflinching poniard of his glance, Steelkilt, clenching his\n",
      "right hand behind him and creepingly drawing it back, told his\n",
      "persecutor that if the hammer but grazed his cheek he (Steelkilt) would\n",
      "murder him. But, gentlemen, the fool had been branded for the slaughter\n",
      "by the gods. Immediately the hammer touched the cheek; the next instant\n",
      "the lower jaw of the mate was stove in his head; he fell on the hatch\n",
      "spouting blood like a whale.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ere the cry could go aft Steelkilt was shaking one of the backstays\n",

      "terrific hint to stop his babbling and betake himself where he\n",

      "of these miscreants must come out.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Upon hearing the frantic project of their leader, each in his own\n",
      "separate soul had suddenly lighted, it would seem, upon the same piece\n",
      "of treachery, namely: to be foremost in breaking out, in order to be\n",
      "the first of the three, though the last of the ten, to surrender; and\n",
      "thereby secure whatever small chance of pardon such conduct might\n",
      "merit. But when Steelkilt made known his determination still to lead\n",
      "them to the last, they in some way, by some subtle chemistry of\n",
      "villany, mixed their before secret treacheries together; and when their\n",
      "leader fell into a doze, verbally opened their souls to each other in\n",
      "three sentences; and bound the sleeper with cords, and gagged him with\n",
      "cords; and shrieked out for the Captain at midnight.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Thinking murder at hand, and smelling in the dark for the blood, he\n",
      "and all his armed mates and harpooneers rushed for the forecastle. In a\n",
      "few minutes the scuttle was opened, and, bound hand and foot, the still\n",
      "struggling ringleader was shoved up into the air by his perfidious\n",
      "allies, who at once claimed the honor of securing a man who had been\n",
      "fully ripe for murder. But all these were collared, and dragged along\n",
      "the deck like dead cattle; and, side by side, were seized up into the\n",
      "mizzen rigging, like three quarters of meat, and there they hung till\n",
      "morning. ‘Damn ye,’ cried the Captain, pacing to and fro before them,\n",
      "‘the vultures would not touch ye, ye villains!’\n",
      "\n",
      "“At sunrise he summoned all hands; and separating those who had\n",
      "rebelled from those who had taken no part in the mutiny, he told the\n",
      "former that he had a good mind to flog them all round—thought, upon the\n",
      "whole, he would do so—he ought to—justice demanded it; but for the\n",
      "present, considering their timely surrender, he would let them go with\n",
      "a reprimand, which he accordingly administered in the vernacular.\n",
      "\n",
      "“‘But as for you, ye carrion rogues,’ turning to the three men in the\n",
      "rigging—‘for you, I mean to mince ye up for the try-pots;’ and, seizing\n",
      "a rope, he applied it with all his might to the backs of the two\n",
      "traitors, till they yelled no more, but lifelessly hung their heads\n",
      "sideways, as the two crucified thieves are drawn.\n",
      "\n",
      "“‘My wrist is sprained with ye!’ he cried, at last; ‘but there is still\n",

      "that gag from his mouth, and let us hear what he can say for himself.’\n",
      "\n",
      "“For a moment the exhausted mutineer made a tremulous motion of his\n",
      "cramped jaws, and then painfully twisting round his head, said in a\n",
      "sort of hiss, ‘What I say is this—and mind it well—if you flog me, I\n",
      "murder you!’\n",
      "\n",
      "“‘Say ye so? then see how ye frighten me’—and the Captain drew off with\n",

      "\n",
      "“‘Best not,’ hissed the Lakeman.\n",
      "\n",
      "“‘But I must,’—and the rope was once more drawn back for the stroke.\n",

      "who, to the amazement of all hands, started back, paced the deck\n",
      "rapidly two or three times, and then suddenly throwing down his rope,\n",
      "said, ‘I won’t do it—let him go—cut him down: d’ye hear?’\n",
      "\n",
      "“But as the junior mates were hurrying to execute the order, a pale\n",
      "man, with a bandaged head, arrested them—Radney the chief mate. Ever\n",
      "since the blow, he had lain in his berth; but that morning, hearing the\n",
      "tumult on the deck, he had crept out, and thus far had watched the\n",
      "whole scene. Such was the state of his mouth, that he could hardly\n",
      "speak; but mumbling something about _his_ being willing and able to do\n",
      "what the captain dared not attempt, he snatched the rope and advanced\n",
      "to his pinioned foe.\n",
      "\n",
      "“‘You are a coward!’ hissed the Lakeman.\n",
      "\n",
      "“‘So I am, but take that.’ The mate was in the very act of striking,\n",
      "when another hiss stayed his uplifted arm. He paused: and then pausing\n",
      "no more, made good his word, spite of Steelkilt’s threat, whatever that\n",
      "might have been. The three men were then cut down, all hands were\n",
      "turned to, and, sullenly worked by the moody seamen, the iron pumps\n",
      "clanged as before.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Just after dark that day, when one watch had retired below, a clamor\n",
      "was heard in the forecastle; and the two trembling traitors running up,\n",
      "besieged the cabin door, saying they durst not consort with the crew.\n",
      "Entreaties, cuffs, and kicks could not drive them back, so at their own\n",
      "instance they were put down in the ship’s run for salvation. Still, no\n",
      "sign of mutiny reappeared among the rest. On the contrary, it seemed,\n",
      "that mainly at Steelkilt’s instigation, they had resolved to maintain\n",
      "the strictest peacefulness, obey all orders to the last, and, when the\n",
      "ship reached port, desert her in a body. But in order to insure the\n",
      "speediest end to the voyage, they all agreed to another thing—namely,\n",
      "not to sing out for whales, in case any should be discovered. For,\n",
      "spite of her leak, and spite of all her other perils, the Town-Ho still\n",
      "maintained her mast-heads, and her captain was just as willing to lower\n",
      "for a fish that moment, as on the day his craft first struck the\n",
      "cruising ground; and Radney the mate was quite as ready to change his\n",
      "berth for a boat, and with his bandaged mouth seek to gag in death the\n",
      "vital jaw of the whale.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But though the Lakeman had induced the seamen to adopt this sort of\n",
      "passiveness in their conduct, he kept his own counsel (at least till\n",
      "all was over) concerning his own proper and private revenge upon the\n",
      "man who had stung him in the ventricles of his heart. He was in Radney\n",
      "the chief mate’s watch; and as if the infatuated man sought to run more\n",
      "than half way to meet his doom, after the scene at the rigging, he\n",
      "insisted, against the express counsel of the captain, upon resuming the\n",
      "head of his watch at night. Upon this, and one or two other\n",
      "circumstances, Steelkilt systematically built the plan of his revenge.\n",
      "\n",
      "“During the night, Radney had an unseamanlike way of sitting on the\n",
      "bulwarks of the quarter-deck, and leaning his arm upon the gunwale of\n",
      "the boat which was hoisted up there, a little above the ship’s side. In\n",
      "this attitude, it was well known, he sometimes dozed. There was a\n",
      "considerable vacancy between the boat and the ship, and down between\n",
      "this was the sea. Steelkilt calculated his time, and found that his\n",
      "next trick at the helm would come round at two o’clock, in the morning\n",
      "of the third day from that in which he had been betrayed. At his\n",
      "leisure, he employed the interval in braiding something very carefully\n",
      "in his watches below.\n",

      "himself in the end, shipmate?’ and going to the mate, he looked at him\n",
      "quietly, and asked him for some twine to mend his hammock. It was given\n",
      "him—neither twine nor lanyard were seen again; but the next night an\n",
      "iron ball, closely netted, partly rolled from the pocket of the\n",

      "dug to the seaman’s hand—that fatal hour was then to come; and in the\n",

      "“It was just between daybreak and sunrise of the morning of the second\n",
      "day, when they were washing down the decks, that a stupid Teneriffe\n",
      "man, drawing water in the main-chains, all at once shouted out, ‘There\n",

      "suddenly perceiving the snowy whale within fifty yards of the\n",
      "ship—forgetful of the compact among the crew—in the excitement of the\n",
      "moment, the Teneriffe man had instinctively and involuntarily lifted\n",
      "his voice for the monster, though for some little time past it had been\n",
      "plainly beheld from the three sullen mast-heads. All was now a phrensy.\n",
      "‘The White Whale—the White Whale!’ was the cry from captain, mates, and\n",
      "harpooneers, who, undeterred by fearful rumours, were all anxious to\n",
      "capture so famous and precious a fish; while the dogged crew eyed\n",
      "askance, and with curses, the appalling beauty of the vast milky mass,\n",
      "that lit up by a horizontal spangling sun, shifted and glistened like a\n",
      "living opal in the blue morning sea. Gentlemen, a strange fatality\n",
      "pervades the whole career of these events, as if verily mapped out\n",
      "before the world itself was charted. The mutineer was the bowsman of\n",
      "the mate, and when fast to a fish, it was his duty to sit next him,\n",
      "while Radney stood up with his lance in the prow, and haul in or\n",
      "slacken the line, at the word of command. Moreover, when the four boats\n",
      "were lowered, the mate’s got the start; and none howled more fiercely\n",
      "with delight than did Steelkilt, as he strained at his oar. After a\n",
      "stiff pull, their harpooneer got fast, and, spear in hand, Radney\n",
      "sprang to the bow. He was always a furious man, it seems, in a boat.\n",
      "And now his bandaged cry was, to beach him on the whale’s topmost back.\n",
      "Nothing loath, his bowsman hauled him up and up, through a blinding\n",
      "foam that blent two whitenesses together; till of a sudden the boat\n",
      "struck as against a sunken ledge, and keeling over, spilled out the\n",
      "standing mate. That instant, as he fell on the whale’s slippery back,\n",
      "the boat righted, and was dashed aside by the swell, while Radney was\n",
      "tossed over into the sea, on the other flank of the whale. He struck\n",
      "out through the spray, and, for an instant, was dimly seen through that\n",
      "veil, wildly seeking to remove himself from the eye of Moby Dick. But\n",
      "the whale rushed round in a sudden maelstrom; seized the swimmer\n",
      "between his jaws; and rearing high up with him, plunged headlong again,\n",
      "and went down.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Meantime, at the first tap of the boat’s bottom, the Lakeman had\n",
      "slackened the line, so as to drop astern from the whirlpool; calmly\n",
      "looking on, he thought his own thoughts. But a sudden, terrific,\n",
      "downward jerking of the boat, quickly brought his knife to the line. He\n",
      "cut it; and the whale was free. But, at some distance, Moby Dick rose\n",
      "again, with some tatters of Radney’s red woollen shirt, caught in the\n",
      "teeth that had destroyed him. All four boats gave chase again; but the\n",
      "whale eluded them, and finally wholly disappeared.\n",
      "\n",
      "“In good time, the Town-Ho reached her port—a savage, solitary\n",
      "place—where no civilized creature resided. There, headed by the\n",
      "Lakeman, all but five or six of the foremastmen deliberately deserted\n",
      "among the palms; eventually, as it turned out, seizing a large double\n",
      "war-canoe of the savages, and setting sail for some other harbor.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The ship’s company being reduced to but a handful, the captain called\n",
      "upon the Islanders to assist him in the laborious business of heaving\n",
      "down the ship to stop the leak. But to such unresting vigilance over\n",
      "their dangerous allies was this small band of whites necessitated, both\n",
      "by night and by day, and so extreme was the hard work they underwent,\n",
      "that upon the vessel being ready again for sea, they were in such a\n",
      "weakened condition that the captain durst not put off with them in so\n",
      "heavy a vessel. After taking counsel with his officers, he anchored the\n",
      "ship as far off shore as possible; loaded and ran out his two cannon\n",
      "from the bows; stacked his muskets on the poop; and warning the\n",
      "Islanders not to approach the ship at their peril, took one man with\n",
      "him, and setting the sail of his best whale-boat, steered straight\n",
      "before the wind for Tahiti, five hundred miles distant, to procure a\n",
      "reinforcement to his crew.\n",
      "\n",
      "“On the fourth day of the sail, a large canoe was descried, which\n",
      "seemed to have touched at a low isle of corals. He steered away from\n",
      "it; but the savage craft bore down on him; and soon the voice of\n",
      "Steelkilt hailed him to heave to, or he would run him under water. The\n",
      "captain presented a pistol. With one foot on each prow of the yoked\n",
      "war-canoes, the Lakeman laughed him to scorn; assuring him that if the\n",
      "pistol so much as clicked in the lock, he would bury him in bubbles and\n",
      "foam.\n",
      "\n",
      "“‘What do you want of me?’ cried the captain.\n",

      "\n",
      "“‘Very good. Let me board you a moment—I come in peace.’ With that he\n",
      "leaped from the canoe, swam to the boat; and climbing the gunwale,\n",
      "stood face to face with the captain.\n",
      "\n",
      "“‘Cross your arms, sir; throw back your head. Now, repeat after me. As\n",
      "soon as Steelkilt leaves me, I swear to beach this boat on yonder\n",

      "me!’\n",

      "“Watching the boat till it was fairly beached, and drawn up to the\n",
      "roots of the cocoa-nut trees, Steelkilt made sail again, and in due\n",
      "time arrived at Tahiti, his own place of destination. There, luck\n",
      "befriended him; two ships were about to sail for France, and were\n",

      "I shall ere long paint to you as well as one can without canvas,\n",
      "something like the true form of the whale as he actually appears to the\n",
      "eye of the whaleman when in his own absolute body the whale is moored\n",
      "alongside the whale-ship so that he can be fairly stepped upon there.\n",
      "It may be worth while, therefore, previously to advert to those curious\n",
      "imaginary portraits of him which even down to the present day\n",
      "confidently challenge the faith of the landsman. It is time to set the\n",
      "world right in this matter, by proving such pictures of the whale all\n",
      "wrong.\n",
      "\n",
      "It may be that the primal source of all those pictorial delusions will\n",
      "be found among the oldest Hindoo, Egyptian, and Grecian sculptures. For\n",
      "ever since those inventive but unscrupulous times when on the marble\n",
      "panellings of temples, the pedestals of statues, and on shields,\n",
      "medallions, cups, and coins, the dolphin was drawn in scales of\n",
      "chain-armor like Saladin’s, and a helmeted head like St. George’s; ever\n",
      "since then has something of the same sort of license prevailed, not\n",
      "only in most popular pictures of the whale, but in many scientific\n",
      "presentations of him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, by all odds, the most ancient extant portrait anyways purporting\n",
      "to be the whale’s, is to be found in the famous cavern-pagoda of\n",

      "sculptures of that immemorial pagoda, all the trades and pursuits,\n",

      "\n",
      "The line originally used in the fishery was of the best hemp, slightly\n",
      "vapored with tar, not impregnated with it, as in the case of ordinary\n",
      "ropes; for while tar, as ordinarily used, makes the hemp more pliable\n",
      "to the rope-maker, and also renders the rope itself more convenient to\n",
      "the sailor for common ship use; yet, not only would the ordinary\n",
      "quantity too much stiffen the whale-line for the close coiling to which\n",
      "it must be subjected; but as most seamen are beginning to learn, tar in\n",
      "general by no means adds to the rope’s durability or strength, however\n",
      "much it may give it compactness and gloss.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of late years the Manilla rope has in the American fishery almost\n",
      "entirely superseded hemp as a material for whale-lines; for, though not\n",
      "so durable as hemp, it is stronger, and far more soft and elastic; and\n",
      "I will add (since there is an æsthetics in all things), is much more\n",
      "handsome and becoming to the boat, than hemp. Hemp is a dusky, dark\n",
      "fellow, a sort of Indian; but Manilla is as a golden-haired Circassian\n",
      "to behold.\n",
      "\n",
      "The whale-line is only two-thirds of an inch in thickness. At first\n",
      "sight, you would not think it so strong as it really is. By experiment\n",
      "its one and fifty yarns will each suspend a weight of one hundred and\n",
      "twenty pounds; so that the whole rope will bear a strain nearly equal\n",
      "to three tons. In length, the common sperm whale-line measures\n",
      "something over two hundred fathoms. Towards the stern of the boat it is\n",
      "spirally coiled away in the tub, not like the worm-pipe of a still\n",
      "though, but so as to form one round, cheese-shaped mass of densely\n",
      "bedded “sheaves,” or layers of concentric spiralizations, without any\n",
      "hollow but the “heart,” or minute vertical tube formed at the axis of\n",
      "the cheese. As the least tangle or kink in the coiling would, in\n",
      "running out, infallibly take somebody’s arm, leg, or entire body off,\n",
      "the utmost precaution is used in stowing the line in its tub. Some\n",
      "harpooneers will consume almost an entire morning in this business,\n",
      "carrying the line high aloft and then reeving it downwards through a\n",
      "block towards the tub, so as in the act of coiling to free it from all\n",
      "possible wrinkles and twists.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the English boats two tubs are used instead of one; the same line\n",
      "being continuously coiled in both tubs. There is some advantage in\n",
      "this; because these twin-tubs being so small they fit more readily into\n",
      "the boat, and do not strain it so much; whereas, the American tub,\n",
      "nearly three feet in diameter and of proportionate depth, makes a\n",
      "rather bulky freight for a craft whose planks are but one half-inch in\n",
      "thickness; for the bottom of the whale-boat is like critical ice, which\n",
      "will bear up a considerable distributed weight, but not very much of a\n",
      "concentrated one. When the painted canvas cover is clapped on the\n",
      "American line-tub, the boat looks as if it were pulling off with a\n",
      "prodigious great wedding-cake to present to the whales.\n",

      "Both ends of the line are exposed; the lower end terminating in an\n",
      "eye-splice or loop coming up from the bottom against the side of the\n",
      "tub, and hanging over its edge completely disengaged from everything.\n",
      "This arrangement of the lower end is necessary on two accounts. First:\n",
      "In order to facilitate the fastening to it of an additional line from a\n",
      "neighboring boat, in case the stricken whale should sound so deep as to\n",
      "threaten to carry off the entire line originally attached to the\n",
      "harpoon. In these instances, the whale of course is shifted like a mug\n",
      "of ale, as it were, from the one boat to the other; though the first\n",
      "boat always hovers at hand to assist its consort. Second: This\n",
      "arrangement is indispensable for common safety’s sake; for were the\n",
      "lower end of the line in any way attached to the boat, and were the\n",
      "whale then to run the line out to the end almost in a single, smoking\n",
      "minute as he sometimes does, he would not stop there, for the doomed\n",
      "boat would infallibly be dragged down after him into the profundity of\n",
      "the sea; and in that case no town-crier would ever find her again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before lowering the boat for the chase, the upper end of the line is\n",
      "taken aft from the tub, and passing round the loggerhead there, is\n",
      "again carried forward the entire length of the boat, resting crosswise\n",
      "upon the loom or handle of every man’s oar, so that it jogs against his\n",
      "wrist in rowing; and also passing between the men, as they alternately\n",
      "sit at the opposite gunwales, to the leaded chocks or grooves in the\n",
      "extreme pointed prow of the boat, where a wooden pin or skewer the size\n",
      "of a common quill, prevents it from slipping out. From the chocks it\n",
      "hangs in a slight festoon over the bows, and is then passed inside the\n",
      "boat again; and some ten or twenty fathoms (called box-line) being\n",
      "coiled upon the box in the bows, it continues its way to the gunwale\n",
      "still a little further aft, and is then attached to the short-warp—the\n",
      "rope which is immediately connected with the harpoon; but previous to\n",
      "that connexion, the short-warp goes through sundry mystifications too\n",
      "tedious to detail.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus the whale-line folds the whole boat in its complicated coils,\n",
      "twisting and writhing around it in almost every direction. All the\n",
      "oarsmen are involved in its perilous contortions; so that to the timid\n",
      "eye of the landsman, they seem as Indian jugglers, with the deadliest\n",
      "snakes sportively festooning their limbs. Nor can any son of mortal\n",

      "unknown instant the harpoon may be darted, and all these horrible\n",
      "contortions be put in play like ringed lightnings; he cannot be thus\n",
      "circumstanced without a shudder that makes the very marrow in his bones\n",
      "to quiver in him like a shaken jelly. Yet habit—strange thing! what\n",
      "cannot habit accomplish?—Gayer sallies, more merry mirth, better jokes,\n",
      "and brighter repartees, you never heard over your mahogany, than you\n",

      "from the spiracle of the whale, and vehement puff after puff from the\n",
      "mouth of the excited headsman; as at every dart, hauling in upon his\n",
      "crooked lance (by the line attached to it), Stubb straightened it again\n",

      "churning and churning, as if cautiously seeking to feel after some gold\n",
      "watch that the whale might have swallowed, and which he was fearful of\n",
      "breaking ere he could hook it out. But that gold watch he sought was\n",
      "the innermost life of the fish. And now it is struck; for, starting\n",
      "from his trance into that unspeakable thing called his “flurry,” the\n",
      "monster horribly wallowed in his blood, overwrapped himself in\n",
      "impenetrable, mad, boiling spray, so that the imperilled craft,\n",

      "gush after gush of clotted red gore, as if it had been the purple lees\n",

      "oar, the one known as the harpooneer-oar. Now it needs a strong,\n",

      "is called a long dart, the heavy implement has to be flung to the\n",
      "distance of twenty or thirty feet. But however prolonged and exhausting\n",
      "the chase, the harpooneer is expected to pull his oar meanwhile to the\n",
      "uttermost; indeed, he is expected to set an example of superhuman\n",
      "activity to the rest, not only by incredible rowing, but by repeated\n",

      "fish, all at once the exhausted harpooneer hears the exciting\n",
      "cry—“Stand up, and give it to him!” He now has to drop and secure his\n",
      "oar, turn round on his centre half way, seize his harpoon from the\n",
      "crotch, and with what little strength may remain, he essays to pitch it\n",
      "somehow into the whale. No wonder, taking the whole fleet of whalemen\n",
      "in a body, that out of fifty fair chances for a dart, not five are\n",
      "successful; no wonder that so many hapless harpooneers are madly cursed\n",
      "and disrated; no wonder that some of them actually burst their\n",

      "\n",
      "Again, if the dart be successful, then at the second critical instant,\n",

      "despair, seemed working in him; as if the sight of that dead body\n",
      "reminded him that Moby Dick was yet to be slain; and though a thousand\n",
      "other whales were brought to his ship, all that would not one jot\n",
      "advance his grand, monomaniac object. Very soon you would have thought\n",
      "from the sound on the Pequod’s decks, that all hands were preparing to\n",
      "cast anchor in the deep; for heavy chains are being dragged along the\n",
      "deck, and thrust rattling out of the port-holes. But by those clanking\n",
      "links, the vast corpse itself, not the ship, is to be moored. Tied by\n",
      "the head to the stern, and by the tail to the bows, the whale now lies\n",
      "with its black hull close to the vessel’s and seen through the darkness\n",
      "of the night, which obscured the spars and rigging aloft, the two—ship\n",
      "and whale, seemed yoked together like colossal bullocks, whereof one\n",
      "reclines while the other remains standing.*\n",
      "\n",
      "*A little item may as well be related here. The strongest and most\n",
      "reliable hold which the ship has upon the whale when moored alongside,\n",
      "is by the flukes or tail; and as from its greater density that part is\n",
      "relatively heavier than any other (excepting the side-fins), its\n",
      "flexibility even in death, causes it to sink low beneath the surface;\n",
      "so that with the hand you cannot get at it from the boat, in order to\n",
      "put the chain round it. But this difficulty is ingeniously overcome: a\n",
      "small, strong line is prepared with a wooden float at its outer end,\n",
      "and a weight in its middle, while the other end is secured to the ship.\n",
      "By adroit management the wooden float is made to rise on the other side\n",
      "of the mass, so that now having girdled the whale, the chain is readily\n",
      "made to follow suit; and being slipped along the body, is at last\n",
      "locked fast round the smallest part of the tail, at the point of\n",
      "junction with its broad flukes or lobes.\n",
      "\n",
      "If moody Ahab was now all quiescence, at least so far as could be known\n",
      "on deck, Stubb, his second mate, flushed with conquest, betrayed an\n",
      "unusual but still good-natured excitement. Such an unwonted bustle was\n",
      "he in that the staid Starbuck, his official superior, quietly resigned\n",
      "to him for the time the sole management of affairs. One small, helping\n",
      "cause of all this liveliness in Stubb, was soon made strangely\n",
      "manifest. Stubb was a high liver; he was somewhat intemperately fond of\n",
      "the whale as a flavorish thing to his palate.\n",
      "\n",
      "“A steak, a steak, ere I sleep! You, Daggoo! overboard you go, and cut\n",

      "thing, and according to the great military maxim, make the enemy defray\n",
      "the current expenses of the war (at least before realizing the proceeds\n",
      "of the voyage), yet now and then you find some of these Nantucketers\n",
      "who have a genuine relish for that particular part of the Sperm Whale\n",
      "designated by Stubb; comprising the tapering extremity of the body.\n",
      "\n",
      "About midnight that steak was cut and cooked; and lighted by two\n",
      "lanterns of sperm oil, Stubb stoutly stood up to his spermaceti supper\n",
      "at the capstan-head, as if that capstan were a sideboard. Nor was Stubb\n",
      "the only banqueter on whale’s flesh that night. Mingling their\n",
      "mumblings with his own mastications, thousands on thousands of sharks,\n",
      "swarming round the dead leviathan, smackingly feasted on its fatness.\n",
      "The few sleepers below in their bunks were often startled by the sharp\n",
      "slapping of their tails against the hull, within a few inches of the\n",
      "sleepers’ hearts. Peering over the side you could just see them (as\n",
      "before you heard them) wallowing in the sullen, black waters, and\n",
      "turning over on their backs as they scooped out huge globular pieces of\n",
      "the whale of the bigness of a human head. This particular feat of the\n",
      "shark seems all but miraculous. How at such an apparently unassailable\n",
      "surface, they contrive to gouge out such symmetrical mouthfuls, remains\n",
      "a part of the universal problem of all things. The mark they thus leave\n",
      "on the whale, may best be likened to the hollow made by a carpenter in\n",
      "countersinking for a screw.\n",
      "\n",
      "Though amid all the smoking horror and diabolism of a sea-fight, sharks\n",
      "will be seen longingly gazing up to the ship’s decks, like hungry dogs\n",
      "round a table where red meat is being carved, ready to bolt down every\n",
      "killed man that is tossed to them; and though, while the valiant\n",
      "butchers over the deck-table are thus cannibally carving each other’s\n",
      "live meat with carving-knives all gilded and tasselled, the sharks,\n",
      "also, with their jewel-hilted mouths, are quarrelsomely carving away\n",
      "under the table at the dead meat; and though, were you to turn the\n",
      "whole affair upside down, it would still be pretty much the same thing,\n",
      "that is to say, a shocking sharkish business enough for all parties;\n",
      "and though sharks also are the invariable outriders of all slave ships\n",
      "crossing the Atlantic, systematically trotting alongside, to be handy\n",
      "in case a parcel is to be carried anywhere, or a dead slave to be\n",
      "decently buried; and though one or two other like instances might be\n",
      "set down, touching the set terms, places, and occasions, when sharks do\n",
      "most socially congregate, and most hilariously feast; yet is there no\n",

      "\n",
      "“Cook, cook!—where’s that old Fleece?” he cried at length, widening his\n",
      "legs still further, as if to form a more secure base for his supper;\n",
      "and, at the same time darting his fork into the dish, as if stabbing\n",

      "to a dead stop on the opposite side of Stubb’s sideboard; when, with\n",
      "both hands folded before him, and resting on his two-legged cane, he\n",

      "the sea, so as to get a good view of his congregation, with the other\n",

      "mouthful at the last word, so that morsel seemed a continuation of the\n",
      "question. “Where were you born, cook?”\n",

      "“’Hind de hatchway, in ferry-boat, goin’ ober de Roanoke.”\n",

      "keeping it there very solemnly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“So, then, you expect to go up into our main-top, do you, cook, when\n",
      "you are dead? But don’t you know the higher you climb, the colder it\n",
      "gets? Main-top, eh?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Didn’t say dat t’all,” said Fleece, again in the sulks.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You said up there, didn’t you? and now look yourself, and see where\n",
      "your tongs are pointing. But, perhaps you expect to get into heaven by\n",
      "crawling through the lubber’s hole, cook; but, no, no, cook, you don’t\n",
      "get there, except you go the regular way, round by the rigging. It’s a\n",
      "ticklish business, but must be done, or else it’s no go. But none of us\n",

      "hear? Hold your hat in one hand, and clap t’other a’top of your heart,\n",
      "when I’m giving my orders, cook. What! that your heart, there?—that’s\n",
      "your gizzard! Aloft! aloft!—that’s it—now you have it. Hold it there\n",
      "now, and pay attention.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“All ’dention,” said the old black, with both hands placed as desired,\n",
      "vainly wriggling his grizzled head, as if to get both ears in front at\n",
      "one and the same time.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well then, cook, you see this whale-steak of yours was so very bad,\n",
      "that I have put it out of sight as soon as possible; you see that,\n",
      "don’t you? Well, for the future, when you cook another whale-steak for\n",
      "my private table here, the capstan, I’ll tell you what to do so as not\n",
      "to spoil it by overdoing. Hold the steak in one hand, and show a live\n",
      "coal to it with the other; that done, dish it; d’ye hear? And now\n",
      "to-morrow, cook, when we are cutting in the fish, be sure you stand by\n",
      "to get the tips of his fins; have them put in pickle. As for the ends\n",

      "CHAPTER 65. The Whale as a Dish.\n",
      "\n",
      "That mortal man should feed upon the creature that feeds his lamp, and,\n",
      "like Stubb, eat him by his own light, as you may say; this seems so\n",
      "outlandish a thing that one must needs go a little into the history and\n",
      "philosophy of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is upon record, that three centuries ago the tongue of the Right\n",
      "Whale was esteemed a great delicacy in France, and commanded large\n",
      "prices there. Also, that in Henry VIIIth’s time, a certain cook of the\n",
      "court obtained a handsome reward for inventing an admirable sauce to be\n",
      "eaten with barbacued porpoises, which, you remember, are a species of\n",
      "whale. Porpoises, indeed, are to this day considered fine eating. The\n",
      "meat is made into balls about the size of billiard balls, and being\n",
      "well seasoned and spiced might be taken for turtle-balls or veal balls.\n",
      "The old monks of Dunfermline were very fond of them. They had a great\n",
      "porpoise grant from the crown.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fact is, that among his hunters at least, the whale would by all\n",
      "hands be considered a noble dish, were there not so much of him; but\n",
      "when you come to sit down before a meat-pie nearly one hundred feet\n",
      "long, it takes away your appetite. Only the most unprejudiced of men\n",
      "like Stubb, nowadays partake of cooked whales; but the Esquimaux are\n",
      "not so fastidious. We all know how they live upon whales, and have rare\n",
      "old vintages of prime old train oil. Zogranda, one of their most famous\n",
      "doctors, recommends strips of blubber for infants, as being exceedingly\n",
      "juicy and nourishing. And this reminds me that certain Englishmen, who\n",
      "long ago were accidentally left in Greenland by a whaling vessel—that\n",
      "these men actually lived for several months on the mouldy scraps of\n",
      "whales which had been left ashore after trying out the blubber. Among\n",
      "the Dutch whalemen these scraps are called “fritters”; which, indeed,\n",
      "they greatly resemble, being brown and crisp, and smelling something\n",
      "like old Amsterdam housewives’ dough-nuts or oly-cooks, when fresh.\n",
      "They have such an eatable look that the most self-denying stranger can\n",
      "hardly keep his hands off.\n",
      "\n",
      "But what further depreciates the whale as a civilized dish, is his\n",
      "exceeding richness. He is the great prize ox of the sea, too fat to be\n",
      "delicately good. Look at his hump, which would be as fine eating as the\n",
      "buffalo’s (which is esteemed a rare dish), were it not such a solid\n",
      "pyramid of fat. But the spermaceti itself, how bland and creamy that\n",
      "is; like the transparent, half-jellied, white meat of a cocoanut in the\n",
      "third month of its growth, yet far too rich to supply a substitute for\n",
      "butter. Nevertheless, many whalemen have a method of absorbing it into\n",
      "some other substance, and then partaking of it. In the long try watches\n",
      "of the night it is a common thing for the seamen to dip their\n",
      "ship-biscuit into the huge oil-pots and let them fry there awhile. Many\n",

      "tossing one arm in frantic gestures, and hurling forth prophecies of\n",
      "speedy doom to the sacrilegious assailants of his divinity. Now, while\n",
      "Macey, the mate, was standing up in his boat’s bow, and with all the\n",
      "reckless energy of his tribe was venting his wild exclamations upon the\n",
      "whale, and essaying to get a fair chance for his poised lance, lo! a\n",
      "broad white shadow rose from the sea; by its quick, fanning motion,\n",
      "temporarily taking the breath out of the bodies of the oarsmen. Next\n",
      "instant, the luckless mate, so full of furious life, was smitten bodily\n",

      "the boat drifted a little towards the ship’s stern; so that, as if by\n",

      "attend upon him while taking that hard-scrabble scramble upon the dead\n",
      "whale’s back. You have seen Italian organ-boys holding a dancing-ape by\n",
      "a long cord. Just so, from the ship’s steep side, did I hold Queequeg\n",
      "down there in the sea, by what is technically called in the fishery a\n",
      "monkey-rope, attached to a strong strip of canvas belted round his\n",

      "It was a humorously perilous business for both of us. For, before we\n",

      "so gross an injustice. And yet still further pondering—while I jerked\n",
      "him now and then from between the whale and ship, which would threaten\n",
      "to jam him—still further pondering, I say, I saw that this situation of\n",
      "mine was the precise situation of every mortal that breathes; only, in\n",
      "most cases, he, one way or other, has this Siamese connexion with a\n",
      "plurality of other mortals. If your banker breaks, you snap; if your\n",

      "he was exposed to. Unappalled by the massacre made upon them during the\n",
      "night, the sharks now freshly and more keenly allured by the before\n",
      "pent blood which began to flow from the carcass—the rabid creatures\n",
      "swarmed round it like bees in a beehive.\n",

      "jerked the poor fellow from too close a vicinity to the maw of what\n",

      "Daggoo continually flourished over his head a couple of keen\n",
      "whale-spades, wherewith they slaughtered as many sharks as they could\n",

      "benevolent of them. They meant Queequeg’s best happiness, I admit; but\n",
      "in their hasty zeal to befriend him, and from the circumstance that\n",
      "both he and the sharks were at times half hidden by the blood-muddled\n",

      "of line yet in the tubs, and the whale not sounding very rapidly, they\n",
      "paid out abundance of rope, and at the same time pulled with all their\n",
      "might so as to get ahead of the ship. For a few minutes the struggle\n",

      "join them, and lay together our own.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of the grand order of folio leviathans, the Sperm Whale and the Right\n",
      "Whale are by far the most noteworthy. They are the only whales\n",
      "regularly hunted by man. To the Nantucketer, they present the two\n",
      "extremes of all the known varieties of the whale. As the external\n",
      "difference between them is mainly observable in their heads; and as a\n",
      "head of each is this moment hanging from the Pequod’s side; and as we\n",
      "may freely go from one to the other, by merely stepping across the\n",
      "deck:—where, I should like to know, will you obtain a better chance to\n",
      "study practical cetology than here?\n",
      "\n",
      "In the first place, you are struck by the general contrast between\n",
      "these heads. Both are massive enough in all conscience; but there is a\n",
      "certain mathematical symmetry in the Sperm Whale’s which the Right\n",
      "Whale’s sadly lacks. There is more character in the Sperm Whale’s head.\n",
      "As you behold it, you involuntarily yield the immense superiority to\n",
      "him, in point of pervading dignity. In the present instance, too, this\n",
      "dignity is heightened by the pepper and salt colour of his head at the\n",
      "summit, giving token of advanced age and large experience. In short, he\n",
      "is what the fishermen technically call a “grey-headed whale.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Let us now note what is least dissimilar in these heads—namely, the two\n",
      "most important organs, the eye and the ear. Far back on the side of the\n",
      "head, and low down, near the angle of either whale’s jaw, if you\n",
      "narrowly search, you will at last see a lashless eye, which you would\n",
      "fancy to be a young colt’s eye; so out of all proportion is it to the\n",
      "magnitude of the head.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, from this peculiar sideway position of the whale’s eyes, it is\n",
      "plain that he can never see an object which is exactly ahead, no more\n",
      "than he can one exactly astern. In a word, the position of the whale’s\n",
      "eyes corresponds to that of a man’s ears; and you may fancy, for\n",
      "yourself, how it would fare with you, did you sideways survey objects\n",
      "through your ears. You would find that you could only command some\n",
      "thirty degrees of vision in advance of the straight side-line of sight;\n",
      "and about thirty more behind it. If your bitterest foe were walking\n",
      "straight towards you, with dagger uplifted in broad day, you would not\n",
      "be able to see him, any more than if he were stealing upon you from\n",
      "behind. In a word, you would have two backs, so to speak; but, at the\n",
      "same time, also, two fronts (side fronts): for what is it that makes\n",
      "the front of a man—what, indeed, but his eyes?\n",
      "\n",
      "Moreover, while in most other animals that I can now think of, the eyes\n",
      "are so planted as imperceptibly to blend their visual power, so as to\n",
      "produce one picture and not two to the brain; the peculiar position of\n",
      "the whale’s eyes, effectually divided as they are by many cubic feet of\n",
      "solid head, which towers between them like a great mountain separating\n",
      "two lakes in valleys; this, of course, must wholly separate the\n",
      "impressions which each independent organ imparts. The whale, therefore,\n",
      "must see one distinct picture on this side, and another distinct\n",
      "picture on that side; while all between must be profound darkness and\n",
      "nothingness to him. Man may, in effect, be said to look out on the\n",
      "world from a sentry-box with two joined sashes for his window. But with\n",
      "the whale, these two sashes are separately inserted, making two\n",
      "distinct windows, but sadly impairing the view. This peculiarity of the\n",
      "whale’s eyes is a thing always to be borne in mind in the fishery; and\n",
      "to be remembered by the reader in some subsequent scenes.\n",
      "\n",
      "A curious and most puzzling question might be started concerning this\n",
      "visual matter as touching the Leviathan. But I must be content with a\n",
      "hint. So long as a man’s eyes are open in the light, the act of seeing\n",
      "is involuntary; that is, he cannot then help mechanically seeing\n",
      "whatever objects are before him. Nevertheless, any one’s experience\n",
      "will teach him, that though he can take in an undiscriminating sweep of\n",
      "things at one glance, it is quite impossible for him, attentively, and\n",
      "completely, to examine any two things—however large or however small—at\n",
      "one and the same instant of time; never mind if they lie side by side\n",
      "and touch each other. But if you now come to separate these two\n",
      "objects, and surround each by a circle of profound darkness; then, in\n",
      "order to see one of them, in such a manner as to bring your mind to\n",
      "bear on it, the other will be utterly excluded from your contemporary\n",
      "consciousness. How is it, then, with the whale? True, both his eyes, in\n",
      "themselves, must simultaneously act; but is his brain so much more\n",
      "comprehensive, combining, and subtle than man’s, that he can at the\n",
      "same moment of time attentively examine two distinct prospects, one on\n",
      "one side of him, and the other in an exactly opposite direction? If he\n",
      "can, then is it as marvellous a thing in him, as if a man were able\n",
      "simultaneously to go through the demonstrations of two distinct\n",
      "problems in Euclid. Nor, strictly investigated, is there any\n",
      "incongruity in this comparison.\n",
      "\n",
      "It may be but an idle whim, but it has always seemed to me, that the\n",
      "extraordinary vacillations of movement displayed by some whales when\n",
      "beset by three or four boats; the timidity and liability to queer\n",
      "frights, so common to such whales; I think that all this indirectly\n",
      "proceeds from the helpless perplexity of volition, in which their\n",
      "divided and diametrically opposite powers of vision must involve them.\n",
      "\n",

      "hours, and never discover that organ. The ear has no external leaf\n",
      "whatever; and into the hole itself you can hardly insert a quill, so\n",
      "wondrously minute is it. It is lodged a little behind the eye. With\n",
      "respect to their ears, this important difference is to be observed\n",
      "between the sperm whale and the right. While the ear of the former has\n",

      "suspended, with his prodigious jaw, some fifteen feet long, hanging\n",
      "straight down at right-angles with his body, for all the world like a\n",
      "ship’s jib-boom. This whale is not dead; he is only dispirited; out of\n",

      "As in general shape the noble Sperm Whale’s head may be compared to a\n",
      "Roman war-chariot (especially in front, where it is so broadly\n",

      "solely on this, you would take the head for the trunk of some huge oak,\n",

      "through the seas of brit in feeding time. In the central blinds of\n",
      "bone, as they stand in their natural order, there are certain curious\n",
      "marks, curves, hollows, and ridges, whereby some whalemen calculate the\n",

      "will seem reasonable.\n",
      "\n",
      "In old times, there seem to have prevailed the most curious fancies\n",

      "\n",
      "*This reminds us that the Right Whale really has a sort of whisker, or\n",
      "rather a moustache, consisting of a few scattered white hairs on the\n",
      "upper part of the outer end of the lower jaw. Sometimes these tufts\n",
      "impart a rather brigandish expression to his otherwise solemn\n",

      "long been on the decline. It was in Queen Anne’s time that the bone was\n",
      "in its glory, the farthingale being then all the fashion. And as those\n",
      "ancient dames moved about gaily, though in the jaws of the whale, as\n",
      "you may say; even so, in a shower, with the like thoughtlessness, do we\n",
      "nowadays fly under the same jaws for protection; the umbrella being a\n",
      "tent spread over the same bone.\n",
      "\n",
      "But now forget all about blinds and whiskers for a moment, and,\n",
      "standing in the Right Whale’s mouth, look around you afresh. Seeing all\n",
      "these colonnades of bone so methodically ranged about, would you not\n",
      "think you were inside of the great Haarlem organ, and gazing upon its\n",
      "thousand pipes? For a carpet to the organ we have a rug of the softest\n",
      "Turkey—the tongue, which is glued, as it were, to the floor of the\n",
      "mouth. It is very fat and tender, and apt to tear in pieces in hoisting\n",
      "it on deck. This particular tongue now before us; at a passing glance I\n",

      "Ere this, you must have plainly seen the truth of what I started\n",

      "different heads. To sum up, then: in the Right Whale’s there is no\n",
      "great well of sperm; no ivory teeth at all; no long, slender mandible\n",
      "of a lower jaw, like the Sperm Whale’s. Nor in the Sperm Whale are\n",
      "there any of those blinds of bone; no huge lower lip; and scarcely\n",

      "perhaps anywhere to be found in all recorded history.\n",
      "\n",
      "You observe that in the ordinary swimming position of the Sperm Whale,\n",
      "the front of his head presents an almost wholly vertical plane to the\n",
      "water; you observe that the lower part of that front slopes\n",
      "considerably backwards, so as to furnish more of a retreat for the long\n",
      "socket which receives the boom-like lower jaw; you observe that the\n",
      "mouth is entirely under the head, much in the same way, indeed, as\n",
      "though your own mouth were entirely under your chin. Moreover you\n",
      "observe that the whale has no external nose; and that what nose he\n",
      "has—his spout hole—is on the top of his head; you observe that his eyes\n",
      "and ears are at the sides of his head, nearly one third of his entire\n",
      "length from the front. Wherefore, you must now have perceived that the\n",
      "front of the Sperm Whale’s head is a dead, blind wall, without a single\n",
      "organ or tender prominence of any sort whatsoever. Furthermore, you are\n",
      "now to consider that only in the extreme, lower, backward sloping part\n",
      "of the front of the head, is there the slightest vestige of bone; and\n",
      "not till you get near twenty feet from the forehead do you come to the\n",

      "figure with a boarding-sword in his hand, was for one swift moment seen\n",
      "hovering over the bulwarks. The next, a loud splash announced that my\n",

      "side, and every eye counted every ripple, as moment followed moment,\n",
      "and no sign of either the sinker or the diver could be seen. Some hands\n",
      "now jumped into a boat alongside, and pushed a little off from the\n",
      "ship.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ha! ha!” cried Daggoo, all at once, from his now quiet, swinging perch\n",
      "overhead; and looking further off from the side, we saw an arm thrust\n",
      "upright from the blue waves; a sight strange to see, as an arm thrust\n",
      "forth from the grass over a grave.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Both! both!—it is both!”—cried Daggoo again with a joyful shout; and\n",
      "soon after, Queequeg was seen boldly striking out with one hand, and\n",
      "with the other clutching the long hair of the Indian. Drawn into the\n",
      "waiting boat, they were quickly brought to the deck; but Tashtego was\n",
      "long in coming to, and Queequeg did not look very brisk.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, how had this noble rescue been accomplished? Why, diving after the\n",
      "slowly descending head, Queequeg with his keen sword had made side\n",
      "lunges near its bottom, so as to scuttle a large hole there; then\n",
      "dropping his sword, had thrust his long arm far inwards and upwards,\n",
      "and so hauled out poor Tash by the head. He averred, that upon first\n",
      "thrusting in for him, a leg was presented; but well knowing that that\n",
      "was not as it ought to be, and might occasion great trouble;—he had\n",
      "thrust back the leg, and by a dexterous heave and toss, had wrought a\n",
      "somerset upon the Indian; so that with the next trial, he came forth in\n",
      "the good old way—head foremost. As for the great head itself, that was\n",
      "doing as well as could be expected.\n",
      "\n",
      "And thus, through the courage and great skill in obstetrics of\n",
      "Queequeg, the deliverance, or rather, delivery of Tashtego, was\n",
      "successfully accomplished, in the teeth, too, of the most untoward and\n",
      "apparently hopeless impediments; which is a lesson by no means to be\n",

      "most corky part about him; and yet thou makest it sink in an element of\n",
      "a far greater specific gravity than itself. We have thee there. Not at\n",
      "all, but I have ye; for at the time poor Tash fell in, the case had\n",
      "been nearly emptied of its lighter contents, leaving little but the\n",
      "dense tendinous wall of the well—a double welded, hammered substance,\n",
      "as I have before said, much heavier than the sea water, and a lump of\n",
      "which sinks in it like lead almost. But the tendency to rapid sinking\n",
      "in this substance was in the present instance materially counteracted\n",
      "by the other parts of the head remaining undetached from it, so that it\n",
      "sank very slowly and deliberately indeed, affording Queequeg a fair\n",

      "like Shakespeare’s or Melancthon’s rise so high, and descend so low,\n",
      "that the eyes themselves seem clear, eternal, tideless mountain lakes;\n",
      "and all above them in the forehead’s wrinkles, you seem to track the\n",
      "antlered thoughts descending there to drink, as the Highland hunters\n",
      "track the snow prints of the deer. But in the great Sperm Whale, this\n",
      "high and mighty god-like dignity inherent in the brow is so immensely\n",
      "amplified, that gazing on it, in that full front view, you feel the\n",

      "Seems it credible that by three such thin threads the great Leviathan\n",

      "\n",
      "“Haul in! Haul in!” cried Starbuck again; “he’s rising.”\n",

      "The lines, of which, hardly an instant before, not one hand’s breadth\n",
      "could have been gained, were now in long quick coils flung back all\n",

      "His motions plainly denoted his extreme exhaustion. In most land\n",
      "animals there are certain valves or flood-gates in many of their veins,\n",
      "whereby when wounded, the blood is in some degree at least instantly\n",
      "shut off in certain directions. Not so with the whale; one of whose\n",
      "peculiarities it is to have an entire non-valvular structure of the\n",
      "blood-vessels, so that when pierced even by so small a point as a\n",
      "harpoon, a deadly drain is at once begun upon his whole arterial\n",
      "system; and when this is heightened by the extraordinary pressure of\n",
      "water at a great distance below the surface, his life may be said to\n",
      "pour from him in incessant streams. Yet so vast is the quantity of\n",
      "blood in him, and so distant and numerous its interior fountains, that\n",
      "he will keep thus bleeding and bleeding for a considerable period; even\n",
      "as in a drought a river will flow, whose source is in the well-springs\n",
      "of far-off and undiscernible hills. Even now, when the boats pulled\n",
      "upon this whale, and perilously drew over his swaying flukes, and the\n",
      "lances were darted into him, they were followed by steady jets from the\n",
      "new made wound, which kept continually playing, while the natural\n",
      "spout-hole in his head was only at intervals, however rapid, sending\n",
      "its affrighted moisture into the air. From this last vent no blood yet\n",
      "came, because no vital part of him had thus far been struck. His life,\n",
      "as they significantly call it, was untouched.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the boats now more closely surrounded him, the whole upper part of\n",
      "his form, with much of it that is ordinarily submerged, was plainly\n",
      "revealed. His eyes, or rather the places where his eyes had been, were\n",
      "beheld. As strange misgrown masses gather in the knot-holes of the\n",
      "noblest oaks when prostrate, so from the points which the whale’s eyes\n",
      "had once occupied, now protruded blind bulbs, horribly pitiable to see.\n",
      "But pity there was none. For all his old age, and his one arm, and his\n",
      "blind eyes, he must die the death and be murdered, in order to light\n",
      "the gay bridals and other merry-makings of men, and also to illuminate\n",
      "the solemn churches that preach unconditional inoffensiveness by all to\n",
      "all. Still rolling in his blood, at last he partially disclosed a\n",

      "\n",
      "But humane Starbuck was too late. At the instant of the dart an\n",
      "ulcerous jet shot from this cruel wound, and goaded by it into more\n",
      "than sufferable anguish, the whale now spouting thick blood, with swift\n",
      "fury blindly darted at the craft, bespattering them and their glorying\n",
      "crews all over with showers of gore, capsizing Flask’s boat and marring\n",
      "the bows. It was his death stroke. For, by this time, so spent was he\n",
      "by loss of blood, that he helplessly rolled away from the wreck he had\n",
      "made; lay panting on his side, impotently flapped with his stumped fin,\n",
      "then over and over slowly revolved like a waning world; turned up the\n",
      "white secrets of his belly; lay like a log, and died. It was most\n",
      "piteous, that last expiring spout. As when by unseen hands the water is\n",
      "gradually drawn off from some mighty fountain, and with half-stifled\n",
      "melancholy gurglings the spray-column lowers and lowers to the\n",
      "ground—so the last long dying spout of the whale.\n",
      "\n",
      "Soon, while the crews were awaiting the arrival of the ship, the body\n",
      "showed symptoms of sinking with all its treasures unrifled.\n",
      "Immediately, by Starbuck’s orders, lines were secured to it at\n",
      "different points, so that ere long every boat was a buoy; the sunken\n",
      "whale being suspended a few inches beneath them by the cords. By very\n",
      "heedful management, when the ship drew nigh, the whale was transferred\n",
      "to her side, and was strongly secured there by the stiffest\n",
      "fluke-chains, for it was plain that unless artificially upheld, the\n",
      "body would at once sink to the bottom.\n",
      "\n",
      "It so chanced that almost upon first cutting into him with the spade,\n",
      "the entire length of a corroded harpoon was found imbedded in his\n",
      "flesh, on the lower part of the bunch before described. But as the\n",
      "stumps of harpoons are frequently found in the dead bodies of captured\n",
      "whales, with the flesh perfectly healed around them, and no prominence\n",
      "of any kind to denote their place; therefore, there must needs have\n",
      "been some other unknown reason in the present case fully to account for\n",
      "the ulceration alluded to. But still more curious was the fact of a\n",
      "lance-head of stone being found in him, not far from the buried iron,\n",
      "the flesh perfectly firm about it. Who had darted that stone lance? And\n",
      "when? It might have been darted by some Nor’ West Indian long before\n",
      "America was discovered.\n",
      "\n",
      "What other marvels might have been rummaged out of this monstrous\n",
      "cabinet there is no telling. But a sudden stop was put to further\n",
      "discoveries, by the ship’s being unprecedentedly dragged over sideways\n",
      "to the sea, owing to the body’s immensely increasing tendency to sink.\n",
      "However, Starbuck, who had the ordering of affairs, hung on to it to\n",
      "the last; hung on to it so resolutely, indeed, that when at length the\n",
      "ship would have been capsized, if still persisting in locking arms with\n",
      "the body; then, when the command was given to break clear from it, such\n",
      "was the immovable strain upon the timber-heads to which the\n",
      "fluke-chains and cables were fastened, that it was impossible to cast\n",
      "them off. Meantime everything in the Pequod was aslant. To cross to the\n",
      "other side of the deck was like walking up the steep gabled roof of a\n",
      "house. The ship groaned and gasped. Many of the ivory inlayings of her\n",
      "bulwarks and cabins were started from their places, by the unnatural\n",
      "dislocation. In vain handspikes and crows were brought to bear upon the\n",
      "immovable fluke-chains, to pry them adrift from the timberheads; and so\n",
      "low had the whale now settled that the submerged ends could not be at\n",
      "all approached, while every moment whole tons of ponderosity seemed\n",
      "added to the sinking bulk, and the ship seemed on the point of going\n",
      "over.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hold on, hold on, won’t ye?” cried Stubb to the body, “don’t be in\n",
      "such a devil of a hurry to sink! By thunder, men, we must do something\n",
      "or go for it. No use prying there; avast, I say with your handspikes,\n",
      "and run one of ye for a prayer book and a pen-knife, and cut the big\n",
      "chains.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Knife? Aye, aye,” cried Queequeg, and seizing the carpenter’s heavy\n",
      "hatchet, he leaned out of a porthole, and steel to iron, began slashing\n",
      "at the largest fluke-chains. But a few strokes, full of sparks, were\n",
      "given, when the exceeding strain effected the rest. With a terrific\n",
      "snap, every fastening went adrift; the ship righted, the carcase sank.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, this occasional inevitable sinking of the recently killed Sperm\n",
      "Whale is a very curious thing; nor has any fisherman yet adequately\n",
      "accounted for it. Usually the dead Sperm Whale floats with great\n",
      "buoyancy, with its side or belly considerably elevated above the\n",
      "surface. If the only whales that thus sank were old, meagre, and\n",
      "broken-hearted creatures, their pads of lard diminished and all their\n",
      "bones heavy and rheumatic; then you might with some reason assert that\n",
      "this sinking is caused by an uncommon specific gravity in the fish so\n",
      "sinking, consequent upon this absence of buoyant matter in him. But it\n",
      "is not so. For young whales, in the highest health, and swelling with\n",
      "noble aspirations, prematurely cut off in the warm flush and May of\n",
      "life, with all their panting lard about them; even these brawny,\n",
      "buoyant heroes do sometimes sink.\n",
      "\n",
      "Be it said, however, that the Sperm Whale is far less liable to this\n",
      "accident than any other species. Where one of that sort go down, twenty\n",
      "Right Whales do. This difference in the species is no doubt imputable\n",
      "in no small degree to the greater quantity of bone in the Right Whale;\n",
      "his Venetian blinds alone sometimes weighing more than a ton; from this\n",
      "incumbrance the Sperm Whale is wholly free. But there are instances\n",
      "where, after the lapse of many hours or several days, the sunken whale\n",
      "again rises, more buoyant than in life. But the reason of this is\n",
      "obvious. Gases are generated in him; he swells to a prodigious\n",
      "magnitude; becomes a sort of animal balloon. A line-of-battle ship\n",
      "could hardly keep him under then. In the Shore Whaling, on soundings,\n",
      "among the Bays of New Zealand, when a Right Whale gives token of\n",
      "sinking, they fasten buoys to him, with plenty of rope; so that when\n",
      "the body has gone down, they know where to look for it when it shall\n",
      "have ascended again.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was not long after the sinking of the body that a cry was heard from\n",
      "the Pequod’s mast-heads, announcing that the Jungfrau was again\n",
      "lowering her boats; though the only spout in sight was that of a\n",
      "Fin-Back, belonging to the species of uncapturable whales, because of\n",
      "its incredible power of swimming. Nevertheless, the Fin-Back’s spout is\n",
      "so similar to the Sperm Whale’s, that by unskilful fishermen it is\n",
      "often mistaken for it. And consequently Derick and all his host were\n",
      "now in valiant chase of this unnearable brute. The Virgin crowding all\n",
      "sail, made after her four young keels, and thus they all disappeared\n",

      "sprinkling and mistifying the gardens of the deep, as with so many\n",

      "noteworthy thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let us, then, look at this matter, along with some interesting items\n",
      "contingent. Every one knows that by the peculiar cunning of their\n",
      "gills, the finny tribes in general breathe the air which at all times\n",
      "is combined with the element in which they swim; hence, a herring or a\n",
      "cod might live a century, and never once raise its head above the\n",
      "surface. But owing to his marked internal structure which gives him\n",
      "regular lungs, like a human being’s, the whale can only live by\n",
      "inhaling the disengaged air in the open atmosphere. Wherefore the\n",
      "necessity for his periodical visits to the upper world. But he cannot\n",
      "in any degree breathe through his mouth, for, in his ordinary attitude,\n",
      "the Sperm Whale’s mouth is buried at least eight feet beneath the\n",
      "surface; and what is still more, his windpipe has no connexion with his\n",
      "mouth. No, he breathes through his spiracle alone; and this is on the\n",
      "top of his head.\n",
      "\n",
      "If I say, that in any creature breathing is only a function\n",
      "indispensable to vitality, inasmuch as it withdraws from the air a\n",
      "certain element, which being subsequently brought into contact with the\n",
      "blood imparts to the blood its vivifying principle, I do not think I\n",
      "shall err; though I may possibly use some superfluous scientific words.\n",
      "Assume it, and it follows that if all the blood in a man could be\n",
      "aerated with one breath, he might then seal up his nostrils and not\n",
      "fetch another for a considerable time. That is to say, he would then\n",
      "live without breathing. Anomalous as it may seem, this is precisely the\n",
      "case with the whale, who systematically lives, by intervals, his full\n",
      "hour and more (when at the bottom) without drawing a single breath, or\n",
      "so much as in any way inhaling a particle of air; for, remember, he has\n",
      "no gills. How is this? Between his ribs and on each side of his spine\n",
      "he is supplied with a remarkable involved Cretan labyrinth of\n",
      "vermicelli-like vessels, which vessels, when he quits the surface, are\n",
      "completely distended with oxygenated blood. So that for an hour or\n",
      "more, a thousand fathoms in the sea, he carries a surplus stock of\n",
      "vitality in him, just as the camel crossing the waterless desert\n",
      "carries a surplus supply of drink for future use in its four\n",
      "supplementary stomachs. The anatomical fact of this labyrinth is\n",
      "indisputable; and that the supposition founded upon it is reasonable\n",
      "and true, seems the more cogent to me, when I consider the otherwise\n",
      "inexplicable obstinacy of that leviathan in _having his spoutings out_,\n",
      "as the fishermen phrase it. This is what I mean. If unmolested, upon\n",
      "rising to the surface, the Sperm Whale will continue there for a period\n",
      "of time exactly uniform with all his other unmolested risings. Say he\n",
      "stays eleven minutes, and jets seventy times, that is, respires seventy\n",
      "breaths; then whenever he rises again, he will be sure to have his\n",
      "seventy breaths over again, to a minute. Now, if after he fetches a few\n",
      "breaths you alarm him, so that he sounds, he will be always dodging up\n",
      "again to make good his regular allowance of air. And not till those\n",
      "seventy breaths are told, will he finally go down to stay out his full\n",
      "term below. Remark, however, that in different individuals these rates\n",
      "are different; but in any one they are alike. Now, why should the whale\n",
      "thus insist upon having his spoutings out, unless it be to replenish\n",
      "his reservoir of air, ere descending for good? How obvious is it, too,\n",
      "that this necessity for the whale’s rising exposes him to all the fatal\n",
      "hazards of the chase. For not by hook or by net could this vast\n",
      "leviathan be caught, when sailing a thousand fathoms beneath the\n",

      "necessities that strike the victory to thee!\n",

      "In man, breathing is incessantly going on—one breath only serving for\n",
      "two or three pulsations; so that whatever other business he has to\n",
      "attend to, waking or sleeping, breathe he must, or die he will. But the\n",
      "Sperm Whale only breathes about one seventh or Sunday of his time.\n",

      "of smelling. But owing to the mystery of the spout—whether it be water\n",
      "or whether it be vapor—no absolute certainty can as yet be arrived at\n",
      "on this head. Sure it is, nevertheless, that the Sperm Whale has no\n",

      "with a sort of locks (that open and shut) for the downward retention of\n",
      "air or the upward exclusion of water, therefore the whale has no voice;\n",
      "unless you insult him by saying, that when he so strangely rumbles, he\n",
      "talks through his nose. But then again, what has the whale to say?\n",
      "Seldom have I known any profound being that had anything to say to this\n",

      "Now, the spouting canal of the Sperm Whale, chiefly intended as it is\n",
      "for the conveyance of air, and for several feet laid along,\n",
      "horizontally, just beneath the upper surface of his head, and a little\n",
      "to one side; this curious canal is very much like a gas-pipe laid down\n",
      "in a city on one side of a street. But the question returns whether\n",
      "this gas-pipe is also a water-pipe; in other words, whether the spout\n",
      "of the Sperm Whale is the mere vapor of the exhaled breath, or whether\n",
      "that exhaled breath is mixed with water taken in at the mouth, and\n",
      "discharged through the spiracle. It is certain that the mouth\n",
      "indirectly communicates with the spouting canal; but it cannot be\n",
      "proved that this is for the purpose of discharging water through the\n",
      "spiracle. Because the greatest necessity for so doing would seem to be,\n",
      "when in feeding he accidentally takes in water. But the Sperm Whale’s\n",
      "food is far beneath the surface, and there he cannot spout even if he\n",
      "would. Besides, if you regard him very closely, and time him with your\n",
      "watch, you will find that when unmolested, there is an undeviating\n",
      "rhyme between the periods of his jets and the ordinary periods of\n",
      "respiration.\n",
      "\n",
      "But why pester one with all this reasoning on the subject? Speak out!\n",
      "You have seen him spout; then declare what the spout is; can you not\n",
      "tell water from air? My dear sir, in this world it is not so easy to\n",
      "settle these plain things. I have ever found your plain things the\n",
      "knottiest of all. And as for this whale spout, you might almost stand\n",
      "in it, and yet be undecided as to what it is precisely.\n",
      "\n",
      "The central body of it is hidden in the snowy sparkling mist enveloping\n",
      "it; and how can you certainly tell whether any water falls from it,\n",
      "when, always, when you are close enough to a whale to get a close view\n",
      "of his spout, he is in a prodigious commotion, the water cascading all\n",
      "around him. And if at such times you should think that you really\n",
      "perceived drops of moisture in the spout, how do you know that they are\n",
      "not merely condensed from its vapor; or how do you know that they are\n",
      "not those identical drops superficially lodged in the spout-hole\n",
      "fissure, which is countersunk into the summit of the whale’s head? For\n",
      "even when tranquilly swimming through the mid-day sea in a calm, with\n",
      "his elevated hump sun-dried as a dromedary’s in the desert; even then,\n",
      "the whale always carries a small basin of water on his head, as under a\n",
      "blazing sun you will sometimes see a cavity in a rock filled up with\n",
      "rain.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nor is it at all prudent for the hunter to be over curious touching the\n",
      "precise nature of the whale spout. It will not do for him to be peering\n",
      "into it, and putting his face in it. You cannot go with your pitcher to\n",
      "this fountain and fill it, and bring it away. For even when coming into\n",
      "slight contact with the outer, vapory shreds of the jet, which will\n",
      "often happen, your skin will feverishly smart, from the acridness of\n",
      "the thing so touching it. And I know one, who coming into still closer\n",
      "contact with the spout, whether with some scientific object in view, or\n",
      "otherwise, I cannot say, the skin peeled off from his cheek and arm.\n",
      "Wherefore, among whalemen, the spout is deemed poisonous; they try to\n",
      "evade it. Another thing; I have heard it said, and I do not much doubt\n",
      "it, that if the jet is fairly spouted into your eyes, it will blind\n",
      "you. The wisest thing the investigator can do then, it seems to me, is\n",

      "account him no common, shallow being, inasmuch as it is an undisputed\n",
      "fact that he is never found on soundings, or near shores; all other\n",
      "whales sometimes are. He is both ponderous and profound. And I am\n",
      "convinced that from the heads of all ponderous profound beings, such as\n",

      "up a certain semi-visible steam, while in the act of thinking deep\n",

      "\n",
      "First: Being horizontal in its position, the Leviathan’s tail acts in a\n",
      "different manner from the tails of all other sea creatures. It never\n",
      "wriggles. In man or fish, wriggling is a sign of inferiority. To the\n",
      "whale, his tail is the sole means of propulsion. Scroll-wise coiled\n",
      "forwards beneath the body, and then rapidly sprung backwards, it is\n",
      "this which gives that singular darting, leaping motion to the monster\n",
      "when furiously swimming. His side-fins only serve to steer by.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second: It is a little significant, that while one sperm whale only\n",
      "fights another sperm whale with his head and jaw, nevertheless, in his\n",
      "conflicts with man, he chiefly and contemptuously uses his tail. In\n",
      "striking at a boat, he swiftly curves away his flukes from it, and the\n",
      "blow is only inflicted by the recoil. If it be made in the unobstructed\n",
      "air, especially if it descend to its mark, the stroke is then simply\n",
      "irresistible. No ribs of man or boat can withstand it. Your only\n",
      "salvation lies in eluding it; but if it comes sideways through the\n",
      "opposing water, then partly owing to the light buoyancy of the\n",
      "whale-boat, and the elasticity of its materials, a cracked rib or a\n",
      "dashed plank or two, a sort of stitch in the side, is generally the\n",
      "most serious result. These submerged side blows are so often received\n",
      "in the fishery, that they are accounted mere child’s play. Some one\n",
      "strips off a frock, and the hole is stopped.\n",
      "\n",
      "Third: I cannot demonstrate it, but it seems to me, that in the whale\n",
      "the sense of touch is concentrated in the tail; for in this respect\n",
      "there is a delicacy in it only equalled by the daintiness of the\n",
      "elephant’s trunk. This delicacy is chiefly evinced in the action of\n",
      "sweeping, when in maidenly gentleness the whale with a certain soft\n",
      "slowness moves his immense flukes from side to side upon the surface of\n",
      "the sea; and if he feel but a sailor’s whisker, woe to that sailor,\n",
      "whiskers and all. What tenderness there is in that preliminary touch!\n",
      "Had this tail any prehensile power, I should straightway bethink me of\n",
      "Darmonodes’ elephant that so frequented the flower-market, and with low\n",
      "salutations presented nosegays to damsels, and then caressed their\n",
      "zones. On more accounts than one, a pity it is that the whale does not\n",
      "possess this prehensile virtue in his tail; for I have heard of yet\n",
      "another elephant, that when wounded in the fight, curved round his\n",
      "trunk and extracted the dart.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fourth: Stealing unawares upon the whale in the fancied security of the\n",
      "middle of solitary seas, you find him unbent from the vast corpulence\n",
      "of his dignity, and kitten-like, he plays on the ocean as if it were a\n",
      "hearth. But still you see his power in his play. The broad palms of his\n",
      "tail are flirted high into the air; then smiting the surface, the\n",
      "thunderous concussion resounds for miles. You would almost think a\n",
      "great gun had been discharged; and if you noticed the light wreath of\n",
      "vapor from the spiracle at his other extremity, you would think that\n",
      "that was the smoke from the touch-hole.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fifth: As in the ordinary floating posture of the leviathan the flukes\n",
      "lie considerably below the level of his back, they are then completely\n",
      "out of sight beneath the surface; but when he is about to plunge into\n",
      "the deeps, his entire flukes with at least thirty feet of his body are\n",
      "tossed erect in the air, and so remain vibrating a moment, till they\n",
      "downwards shoot out of view. Excepting the sublime _breach_—somewhere\n",
      "else to be described—this peaking of the whale’s flukes is perhaps the\n",
      "grandest sight to be seen in all animated nature. Out of the bottomless\n",
      "profundities the gigantic tail seems spasmodically snatching at the\n",
      "highest heaven. So in dreams, have I seen majestic Satan thrusting\n",
      "forth his tormented colossal claw from the flame Baltic of Hell. But in\n",
      "gazing at such scenes, it is all in all what mood you are in; if in the\n",
      "Dantean, the devils will occur to you; if in that of Isaiah, the\n",
      "archangels. Standing at the mast-head of my ship during a sunrise that\n",
      "crimsoned sky and sea, I once saw a large herd of whales in the east,\n",
      "all heading towards the sun, and for a moment vibrating in concert with\n",
      "peaked flukes. As it seemed to me at the time, such a grand embodiment\n",
      "of adoration of the gods was never beheld, even in Persia, the home of\n",
      "the fire worshippers. As Ptolemy Philopater testified of the African\n",
      "elephant, I then testified of the whale, pronouncing him the most\n",
      "devout of all beings. For according to King Juba, the military\n",

      "The chance comparison in this chapter, between the whale and the\n",

      "of the other are concerned, should not tend to place those two opposite\n",
      "organs on an equality, much less the creatures to which they\n",
      "respectively belong. For as the mightiest elephant is but a terrier to\n",
      "Leviathan, so, compared with Leviathan’s tail, his trunk is but the\n",
      "stalk of a lily. The most direful blow from the elephant’s trunk were\n",
      "as the playful tap of a fan, compared with the measureless crush and\n",
      "crash of the sperm whale’s ponderous flukes, which in repeated\n",

      "outlets, crowding, trampling, jamming, and remorselessly dashing each\n",
      "other to death. Best, therefore, withhold any amazement at the\n",
      "strangely gallied whales before us, for there is no folly of the beasts\n",
      "of the earth which is not infinitely outdone by the madness of men.\n",
      "\n",
      "Though many of the whales, as has been said, were in violent motion,\n",
      "yet it is to be observed that as a whole the herd neither advanced nor\n",
      "retreated, but collectively remained in one place. As is customary in\n",
      "those cases, the boats at once separated, each making for some one lone\n",
      "whale on the outskirts of the shoal. In about three minutes’ time,\n",
      "Queequeg’s harpoon was flung; the stricken fish darted blinding spray\n",
      "in our faces, and then running away with us like light, steered\n",
      "straight for the heart of the herd. Though such a movement on the part\n",
      "of the whale struck under such circumstances, is in no wise\n",
      "unprecedented; and indeed is almost always more or less anticipated;\n",
      "yet does it present one of the more perilous vicissitudes of the\n",
      "fishery. For as the swift monster drags you deeper and deeper into the\n",
      "frantic shoal, you bid adieu to circumspect life and only exist in a\n",
      "delirious throb.\n",
      "\n",
      "As, blind and deaf, the whale plunged forward, as if by sheer power of\n",
      "speed to rid himself of the iron leech that had fastened to him; as we\n",
      "thus tore a white gash in the sea, on all sides menaced as we flew, by\n",
      "the crazed creatures to and fro rushing about us; our beset boat was\n",
      "like a ship mobbed by ice-isles in a tempest, and striving to steer\n",
      "through their complicated channels and straits, knowing not at what\n",
      "moment it may be locked in and crushed.\n",
      "\n",
      "But not a bit daunted, Queequeg steered us manfully; now sheering off\n",
      "from this monster directly across our route in advance; now edging away\n",
      "from that, whose colossal flukes were suspended overhead, while all the\n",
      "time, Starbuck stood up in the bows, lance in hand, pricking out of our\n",
      "way whatever whales he could reach by short darts, for there was no\n",
      "time to make long ones. Nor were the oarsmen quite idle, though their\n",
      "wonted duty was now altogether dispensed with. They chiefly attended to\n",
      "the shouting part of the business. “Out of the way, Commodore!” cried\n",
      "one, to a great dromedary that of a sudden rose bodily to the surface,\n",
      "and for an instant threatened to swamp us. “Hard down with your tail,\n",
      "there!” cried a second to another, which, close to our gunwale, seemed\n",
      "calmly cooling himself with his own fan-like extremity.\n",
      "\n",
      "All whaleboats carry certain curious contrivances, originally invented\n",
      "by the Nantucket Indians, called druggs. Two thick squares of wood of\n",
      "equal size are stoutly clenched together, so that they cross each\n",
      "other’s grain at right angles; a line of considerable length is then\n",
      "attached to the middle of this block, and the other end of the line\n",
      "being looped, it can in a moment be fastened to a harpoon. It is\n",
      "chiefly among gallied whales that this drugg is used. For then, more\n",
      "whales are close round you than you can possibly chase at one time. But\n",
      "sperm whales are not every day encountered; while you may, then, you\n",
      "must kill all you can. And if you cannot kill them all at once, you\n",
      "must wing them, so that they can be afterwards killed at your leisure.\n",
      "Hence it is, that at times like these the drugg, comes into\n",
      "requisition. Our boat was furnished with three of them. The first and\n",
      "second were successfully darted, and we saw the whales staggeringly\n",
      "running off, fettered by the enormous sidelong resistance of the towing\n",
      "drugg. They were cramped like malefactors with the chain and ball. But\n",
      "upon flinging the third, in the act of tossing overboard the clumsy\n",
      "wooden block, it caught under one of the seats of the boat, and in an\n",
      "instant tore it out and carried it away, dropping the oarsman in the\n",
      "boat’s bottom as the seat slid from under him. On both sides the sea\n",
      "came in at the wounded planks, but we stuffed two or three drawers and\n",
      "shirts in, and so stopped the leaks for the time.\n",
      "\n",
      "It had been next to impossible to dart these drugged-harpoons, were it\n",
      "not that as we advanced into the herd, our whale’s way greatly\n",
      "diminished; moreover, that as we went still further and further from\n",
      "the circumference of commotion, the direful disorders seemed waning. So\n",
      "that when at last the jerking harpoon drew out, and the towing whale\n",
      "sideways vanished; then, with the tapering force of his parting\n",
      "momentum, we glided between two whales into the innermost heart of the\n",
      "shoal, as if from some mountain torrent we had slid into a serene\n",
      "valley lake. Here the storms in the roaring glens between the outermost\n",
      "whales, were heard but not felt. In this central expanse the sea\n",
      "presented that smooth satin-like surface, called a sleek, produced by\n",
      "the subtle moisture thrown off by the whale in his more quiet moods.\n",
      "Yes, we were now in that enchanted calm which they say lurks at the\n",
      "heart of every commotion. And still in the distracted distance we\n",
      "beheld the tumults of the outer concentric circles, and saw successive\n",
      "pods of whales, eight or ten in each, swiftly going round and round,\n",
      "like multiplied spans of horses in a ring; and so closely shoulder to\n",
      "shoulder, that a Titanic circus-rider might easily have over-arched the\n",
      "middle ones, and so have gone round on their backs. Owing to the\n",
      "density of the crowd of reposing whales, more immediately surrounding\n",
      "the embayed axis of the herd, no possible chance of escape was at\n",
      "present afforded us. We must watch for a breach in the living wall that\n",
      "hemmed us in; the wall that had only admitted us in order to shut us\n",
      "up. Keeping at the centre of the lake, we were occasionally visited by\n",
      "small tame cows and calves; the women and children of this routed host.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, inclusive of the occasional wide intervals between the revolving\n",
      "outer circles, and inclusive of the spaces between the various pods in\n",
      "any one of those circles, the entire area at this juncture, embraced by\n",
      "the whole multitude, must have contained at least two or three square\n",
      "miles. At any rate—though indeed such a test at such a time might be\n",
      "deceptive—spoutings might be discovered from our low boat that seemed\n",
      "playing up almost from the rim of the horizon. I mention this\n",
      "circumstance, because, as if the cows and calves had been purposely\n",
      "locked up in this innermost fold; and as if the wide extent of the herd\n",
      "had hitherto prevented them from learning the precise cause of its\n",
      "stopping; or, possibly, being so young, unsophisticated, and every way\n",
      "innocent and inexperienced; however it may have been, these smaller\n",
      "whales—now and then visiting our becalmed boat from the margin of the\n",
      "lake—evinced a wondrous fearlessness and confidence, or else a still\n",
      "becharmed panic which it was impossible not to marvel at. Like\n",
      "household dogs they came snuffling round us, right up to our gunwales,\n",
      "and touching them; till it almost seemed that some spell had suddenly\n",
      "domesticated them. Queequeg patted their foreheads; Starbuck scratched\n",
      "their backs with his lance; but fearful of the consequences, for the\n",
      "time refrained from darting it.\n",
      "\n",
      "But far beneath this wondrous world upon the surface, another and still\n",
      "stranger world met our eyes as we gazed over the side. For, suspended\n",
      "in those watery vaults, floated the forms of the nursing mothers of the\n",
      "whales, and those that by their enormous girth seemed shortly to become\n",
      "mothers. The lake, as I have hinted, was to a considerable depth\n",
      "exceedingly transparent; and as human infants while suckling will\n",
      "calmly and fixedly gaze away from the breast, as if leading two\n",
      "different lives at the time; and while yet drawing mortal nourishment,\n",
      "be still spiritually feasting upon some unearthly reminiscence;—even so\n",
      "did the young of these whales seem looking up towards us, but not at\n",
      "us, as if we were but a bit of Gulfweed in their new-born sight.\n",
      "Floating on their sides, the mothers also seemed quietly eyeing us. One\n",
      "of these little infants, that from certain queer tokens seemed hardly a\n",
      "day old, might have measured some fourteen feet in length, and some six\n",
      "feet in girth. He was a little frisky; though as yet his body seemed\n",
      "scarce yet recovered from that irksome position it had so lately\n",
      "occupied in the maternal reticule; where, tail to head, and all ready\n",
      "for the final spring, the unborn whale lies bent like a Tartar’s bow.\n",
      "The delicate side-fins, and the palms of his flukes, still freshly\n",
      "retained the plaited crumpled appearance of a baby’s ears newly arrived\n",
      "from foreign parts.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Line! line!” cried Queequeg, looking over the gunwale; “him fast! him\n",
      "fast!—Who line him! Who struck?—Two whale; one big, one little!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What ails ye, man?” cried Starbuck.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Look-e here,” said Queequeg, pointing down.\n",
      "\n",
      "As when the stricken whale, that from the tub has reeled out hundreds\n",
      "of fathoms of rope; as, after deep sounding, he floats up again, and\n",
      "shows the slackened curling line buoyantly rising and spiralling\n",
      "towards the air; so now, Starbuck saw long coils of the umbilical cord\n",
      "of Madame Leviathan, by which the young cub seemed still tethered to\n",
      "its dam. Not seldom in the rapid vicissitudes of the chase, this\n",
      "natural line, with the maternal end loose, becomes entangled with the\n",
      "hempen one, so that the cub is thereby trapped. Some of the subtlest\n",
      "secrets of the seas seemed divulged to us in this enchanted pond. We\n",
      "saw young Leviathan amours in the deep.*\n",
      "\n",
      "*The sperm whale, as with all other species of the Leviathan, but\n",
      "unlike most other fish, breeds indifferently at all seasons; after a\n",
      "gestation which may probably be set down at nine months, producing but\n",
      "one at a time; though in some few known instances giving birth to an\n",
      "Esau and Jacob:—a contingency provided for in suckling by two teats,\n",
      "curiously situated, one on each side of the anus; but the breasts\n",
      "themselves extend upwards from that. When by chance these precious\n",
      "parts in a nursing whale are cut by the hunter’s lance, the mother’s\n",
      "pouring milk and blood rivallingly discolour the sea for rods. The milk\n",
      "is very sweet and rich; it has been tasted by man; it might do well\n",
      "with strawberries. When overflowing with mutual esteem, the whales\n",
      "salute _more hominum_.\n",
      "\n",
      "And thus, though surrounded by circle upon circle of consternations and\n",
      "affrights, did these inscrutable creatures at the centre freely and\n",
      "fearlessly indulge in all peaceful concernments; yea, serenely revelled\n",
      "in dalliance and delight. But even so, amid the tornadoed Atlantic of\n",
      "my being, do I myself still for ever centrally disport in mute calm;\n",
      "and while ponderous planets of unwaning woe revolve round me, deep down\n",
      "and deep inland there I still bathe me in eternal mildness of joy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, as we thus lay entranced, the occasional sudden frantic\n",
      "spectacles in the distance evinced the activity of the other boats,\n",
      "still engaged in drugging the whales on the frontier of the host; or\n",
      "possibly carrying on the war within the first circle, where abundance\n",
      "of room and some convenient retreats were afforded them. But the sight\n",
      "of the enraged drugged whales now and then blindly darting to and fro\n",
      "across the circles, was nothing to what at last met our eyes. It is\n",
      "sometimes the custom when fast to a whale more than commonly powerful\n",
      "and alert, to seek to hamstring him, as it were, by sundering or\n",
      "maiming his gigantic tail-tendon. It is done by darting a short-handled\n",
      "cutting-spade, to which is attached a rope for hauling it back again. A\n",
      "whale wounded (as we afterwards learned) in this part, but not\n",
      "effectually, as it seemed, had broken away from the boat, carrying\n",
      "along with him half of the harpoon line; and in the extraordinary agony\n",
      "of the wound, he was now dashing among the revolving circles like the\n",
      "lone mounted desperado Arnold, at the battle of Saratoga, carrying\n",
      "dismay wherever he went.\n",
      "\n",
      "But agonizing as was the wound of this whale, and an appalling\n",
      "spectacle enough, any way; yet the peculiar horror with which he seemed\n",
      "to inspire the rest of the herd, was owing to a cause which at first\n",
      "the intervening distance obscured from us. But at length we perceived\n",
      "that by one of the unimaginable accidents of the fishery, this whale\n",
      "had become entangled in the harpoon-line that he towed; he had also run\n",
      "away with the cutting-spade in him; and while the free end of the rope\n",
      "attached to that weapon, had permanently caught in the coils of the\n",
      "harpoon-line round his tail, the cutting-spade itself had worked loose\n",
      "from his flesh. So that tormented to madness, he was now churning\n",
      "through the water, violently flailing with his flexible tail, and\n",
      "tossing the keen spade about him, wounding and murdering his own\n",
      "comrades.\n",
      "\n",
      "This terrific object seemed to recall the whole herd from their\n",
      "stationary fright. First, the whales forming the margin of our lake\n",
      "began to crowd a little, and tumble against each other, as if lifted by\n",
      "half spent billows from afar; then the lake itself began faintly to\n",
      "heave and swell; the submarine bridal-chambers and nurseries vanished;\n",
      "in more and more contracting orbits the whales in the more central\n",
      "circles began to swim in thickening clusters. Yes, the long calm was\n",
      "departing. A low advancing hum was soon heard; and then like to the\n",
      "tumultuous masses of block-ice when the great river Hudson breaks up in\n",
      "Spring, the entire host of whales came tumbling upon their inner\n",
      "centre, as if to pile themselves up in one common mountain. Instantly\n",
      "Starbuck and Queequeg changed places; Starbuck taking the stern.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oars! Oars!” he intensely whispered, seizing the helm—“gripe your\n",
      "oars, and clutch your souls, now! My God, men, stand by! Shove him off,\n",
      "you Queequeg—the whale there!—prick him!—hit him! Stand up—stand up,\n",
      "and stay so! Spring, men—pull, men; never mind their backs—scrape\n",
      "them!—scrape away!”\n",
      "\n",
      "The boat was now all but jammed between two vast black bulks, leaving a\n",
      "narrow Dardanelles between their long lengths. But by desperate\n",
      "endeavor we at last shot into a temporary opening; then giving way\n",
      "rapidly, and at the same time earnestly watching for another outlet.\n",
      "After many similar hair-breadth escapes, we at last swiftly glided into\n",
      "what had just been one of the outer circles, but now crossed by random\n",
      "whales, all violently making for one centre. This lucky salvation was\n",
      "cheaply purchased by the loss of Queequeg’s hat, who, while standing in\n",
      "the bows to prick the fugitive whales, had his hat taken clean from his\n",
      "head by the air-eddy made by the sudden tossing of a pair of broad\n",
      "flukes close by.\n",
      "\n",
      "Riotous and disordered as the universal commotion now was, it soon\n",
      "resolved itself into what seemed a systematic movement; for having\n",
      "clumped together at last in one dense body, they then renewed their\n",
      "onward flight with augmented fleetness. Further pursuit was useless;\n",
      "but the boats still lingered in their wake to pick up what drugged\n",
      "whales might be dropped astern, and likewise to secure one which Flask\n",
      "had killed and waifed. The waif is a pennoned pole, two or three of\n",
      "which are carried by every boat; and which, when additional game is at\n",
      "hand, are inserted upright into the floating body of a dead whale, both\n",
      "to mark its place on the sea, and also as token of prior possession,\n",
      "should the boats of any other ship draw near.\n",
      "\n",
      "The result of this lowering was somewhat illustrative of that sagacious\n",
      "saying in the Fishery,—the more whales the less fish. Of all the\n",
      "drugged whales only one was captured. The rest contrived to escape for\n",
      "the time, but only to be taken, as will hereafter be seen, by some\n",
      "other craft than the Pequod.\n",

      "CHAPTER 88. Schools and Schoolmasters.\n",
      "\n",
      "The previous chapter gave account of an immense body or herd of Sperm\n",
      "Whales, and there was also then given the probable cause inducing those\n",
      "vast aggregations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, though such great bodies are at times encountered, yet, as must\n",
      "have been seen, even at the present day, small detached bands are\n",
      "occasionally observed, embracing from twenty to fifty individuals each.\n",
      "Such bands are known as schools. They generally are of two sorts; those\n",
      "composed almost entirely of females, and those mustering none but young\n",
      "vigorous males, or bulls, as they are familiarly designated.\n",
      "\n",
      "In cavalier attendance upon the school of females, you invariably see a\n",
      "male of full grown magnitude, but not old; who, upon any alarm, evinces\n",
      "his gallantry by falling in the rear and covering the flight of his\n",
      "ladies. In truth, this gentleman is a luxurious Ottoman, swimming about\n",
      "over the watery world, surroundingly accompanied by all the solaces and\n",
      "endearments of the harem. The contrast between this Ottoman and his\n",
      "concubines is striking; because, while he is always of the largest\n",
      "leviathanic proportions, the ladies, even at full growth, are not more\n",
      "than one-third of the bulk of an average-sized male. They are\n",
      "comparatively delicate, indeed; I dare say, not to exceed half a dozen\n",
      "yards round the waist. Nevertheless, it cannot be denied, that upon the\n",
      "whole they are hereditarily entitled to _en bon point_.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is very curious to watch this harem and its lord in their indolent\n",
      "ramblings. Like fashionables, they are for ever on the move in\n",
      "leisurely search of variety. You meet them on the Line in time for the\n",
      "full flower of the Equatorial feeding season, having just returned,\n",
      "perhaps, from spending the summer in the Northern seas, and so cheating\n",
      "summer of all unpleasant weariness and warmth. By the time they have\n",
      "lounged up and down the promenade of the Equator awhile, they start for\n",
      "the Oriental waters in anticipation of the cool season there, and so\n",
      "evade the other excessive temperature of the year.\n",
      "\n",
      "When serenely advancing on one of these journeys, if any strange\n",
      "suspicious sights are seen, my lord whale keeps a wary eye on his\n",
      "interesting family. Should any unwarrantably pert young Leviathan\n",
      "coming that way, presume to draw confidentially close to one of the\n",
      "ladies, with what prodigious fury the Bashaw assails him, and chases\n",
      "him away! High times, indeed, if unprincipled young rakes like him are\n",
      "to be permitted to invade the sanctity of domestic bliss; though do\n",
      "what the Bashaw will, he cannot keep the most notorious Lothario out of\n",
      "his bed; for, alas! all fish bed in common. As ashore, the ladies often\n",
      "cause the most terrible duels among their rival admirers; just so with\n",
      "the whales, who sometimes come to deadly battle, and all for love. They\n",
      "fence with their long lower jaws, sometimes locking them together, and\n",
      "so striving for the supremacy like elks that warringly interweave their\n",
      "antlers. Not a few are captured having the deep scars of these\n",

      "But supposing the invader of domestic bliss to betake himself away at\n",
      "the first rush of the harem’s lord, then is it very diverting to watch\n",
      "that lord. Gently he insinuates his vast bulk among them again and\n",
      "revels there awhile, still in tantalizing vicinity to young Lothario,\n",
      "like pious Solomon devoutly worshipping among his thousand concubines.\n",
      "Granting other whales to be in sight, the fishermen will seldom give\n",
      "chase to one of these Grand Turks; for these Grand Turks are too lavish\n",
      "of their strength, and hence their unctuousness is small. As for the\n",
      "sons and the daughters they beget, why, those sons and daughters must\n",
      "take care of themselves; at least, with only the maternal help. For\n",
      "like certain other omnivorous roving lovers that might be named, my\n",

      "and so, being a great traveller, he leaves his anonymous babies all\n",
      "over the world; every baby an exotic. In good time, nevertheless, as\n",
      "the ardour of youth declines; as years and dumps increase; as\n",
      "reflection lends her solemn pauses; in short, as a general lassitude\n",
      "overtakes the sated Turk; then a love of ease and virtue supplants the\n",
      "love for maidens; our Ottoman enters upon the impotent, repentant,\n",
      "admonitory stage of life, forswears, disbands the harem, and grown to\n",

      "go abroad inculcating not what he learned there, but the folly of it.\n",
      "His title, schoolmaster, would very naturally seem derived from the\n",
      "name bestowed upon the harem itself, but some have surmised that the\n",

      "their lives, obliged to forsake not only their lines, but their boat\n",
      "itself. Ultimately the defendants (the crew of another ship) came up\n",
      "with the whale, struck, killed, seized, and finally appropriated it\n",
      "before the very eyes of the plaintiffs. And when those defendants were\n",
      "remonstrated with, their captain snapped his fingers in the plaintiffs’\n",

      "Mr. Erskine was counsel for the defendants; Lord Ellenborough was the\n",

      "wherein a gentleman, after in vain trying to bridle his wife’s\n",
      "viciousness, had at last abandoned her upon the seas of life; but in\n",
      "the course of years, repenting of that step, he instituted an action to\n",
      "recover possession of her. Erskine was on the other side; and he then\n",
      "supported it by saying, that though the gentleman had originally\n",
      "harpooned the lady, and had once had her fast, and only by reason of\n",
      "the great stress of her plunging viciousness, had at last abandoned\n",
      "her; yet abandon her he did, so that she became a loose-fish; and\n",

      "acquired a property in those articles; and hence anybody who afterwards\n",

      "present of a little oil for dear charity’s sake. For what oil he’ll get\n",
      "from that drugged whale there, wouldn’t be fit to burn in a jail; no,\n",
      "not in a condemned cell. And as for the other whale, why, I’ll agree to\n",
      "get more oil by chopping up and trying out these three masts of ours,\n",
      "than he’ll get from that bundle of bones; though, now that I think of\n",
      "it, it may contain something worth a good deal more than oil; yes,\n",
      "ambergris. I wonder now if our old man has thought of that. It’s worth\n",
      "trying. Yes, I’m for it;” and so saying he started for the\n",
      "quarter-deck.\n",
      "\n",
      "By this time the faint air had become a complete calm; so that whether\n",
      "or no, the Pequod was now fairly entrapped in the smell, with no hope\n",
      "of escaping except by its breezing up again. Issuing from the cabin,\n",
      "Stubb now called his boat’s crew, and pulled off for the stranger.\n",
      "Drawing across her bow, he perceived that in accordance with the\n",
      "fanciful French taste, the upper part of her stem-piece was carved in\n",
      "the likeness of a huge drooping stalk, was painted green, and for\n",
      "thorns had copper spikes projecting from it here and there; the whole\n",
      "terminating in a symmetrical folded bulb of a bright red colour. Upon\n",
      "her head boards, in large gilt letters, he read “Bouton de\n",
      "Rose,”—Rose-button, or Rose-bud; and this was the romantic name of this\n",
      "aromatic ship.\n",
      "\n",
      "Though Stubb did not understand the _Bouton_ part of the inscription,\n",
      "yet the word _rose_, and the bulbous figure-head put together,\n",
      "sufficiently explained the whole to him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“A wooden rose-bud, eh?” he cried with his hand to his nose, “that will\n",
      "do very well; but how like all creation it smells!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Now in order to hold direct communication with the people on deck, he\n",
      "had to pull round the bows to the starboard side, and thus come close\n",
      "to the blasted whale; and so talk over it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Arrived then at this spot, with one hand still to his nose, he\n",
      "bawled—“Bouton-de-Rose, ahoy! are there any of you Bouton-de-Roses that\n",
      "speak English?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes,” rejoined a Guernsey-man from the bulwarks, who turned out to be\n",
      "the chief-mate.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, then, my Bouton-de-Rose-bud, have you seen the White Whale?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“_What_ whale?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“The _White_ Whale—a Sperm Whale—Moby Dick, have ye seen him?\n",
      "\n",
      "“Never heard of such a whale. Cachalot Blanche! White Whale—no.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Very good, then; good bye now, and I’ll call again in a minute.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then rapidly pulling back towards the Pequod, and seeing Ahab leaning\n",
      "over the quarter-deck rail awaiting his report, he moulded his two\n",
      "hands into a trumpet and shouted—“No, Sir! No!” Upon which Ahab\n",
      "retired, and Stubb returned to the Frenchman.\n",
      "\n",
      "He now perceived that the Guernsey-man, who had just got into the\n",
      "chains, and was using a cutting-spade, had slung his nose in a sort of\n",
      "bag.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What’s the matter with your nose, there?” said Stubb. “Broke it?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I wish it was broken, or that I didn’t have any nose at all!” answered\n",
      "the Guernsey-man, who did not seem to relish the job he was at very\n",
      "much. “But what are you holding _yours_ for?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, nothing! It’s a wax nose; I have to hold it on. Fine day, ain’t\n",
      "it? Air rather gardenny, I should say; throw us a bunch of posies, will\n",
      "ye, Bouton-de-Rose?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What in the devil’s name do you want here?” roared the Guernseyman,\n",
      "flying into a sudden passion.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh! keep cool—cool? yes, that’s the word! why don’t you pack those\n",
      "whales in ice while you’re working at ’em? But joking aside, though; do\n",
      "you know, Rose-bud, that it’s all nonsense trying to get any oil out of\n",
      "such whales? As for that dried up one, there, he hasn’t a gill in his\n",
      "whole carcase.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I know that well enough; but, d’ye see, the Captain here won’t believe\n",
      "it; this is his first voyage; he was a Cologne manufacturer before. But\n",
      "come aboard, and mayhap he’ll believe you, if he won’t me; and so I’ll\n",
      "get out of this dirty scrape.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Anything to oblige ye, my sweet and pleasant fellow,” rejoined Stubb,\n",
      "and with that he soon mounted to the deck. There a queer scene\n",
      "presented itself. The sailors, in tasselled caps of red worsted, were\n",
      "getting the heavy tackles in readiness for the whales. But they worked\n",
      "rather slow and talked very fast, and seemed in anything but a good\n",
      "humor. All their noses upwardly projected from their faces like so many\n",
      "jib-booms. Now and then pairs of them would drop their work, and run up\n",
      "to the mast-head to get some fresh air. Some thinking they would catch\n",
      "the plague, dipped oakum in coal-tar, and at intervals held it to their\n",
      "nostrils. Others having broken the stems of their pipes almost short\n",
      "off at the bowl, were vigorously puffing tobacco-smoke, so that it\n",
      "constantly filled their olfactories.\n",
      "\n",
      "Stubb was struck by a shower of outcries and anathemas proceeding from\n",
      "the Captain’s round-house abaft; and looking in that direction saw a\n",
      "fiery face thrust from behind the door, which was held ajar from\n",
      "within. This was the tormented surgeon, who, after in vain\n",
      "remonstrating against the proceedings of the day, had betaken himself\n",
      "to the Captain’s round-house (_cabinet_ he called it) to avoid the\n",
      "pest; but still, could not help yelling out his entreaties and\n",
      "indignations at times.\n",
      "\n",
      "Marking all this, Stubb argued well for his scheme, and turning to the\n",
      "Guernsey-man had a little chat with him, during which the stranger mate\n",
      "expressed his detestation of his Captain as a conceited ignoramus, who\n",
      "had brought them all into so unsavory and unprofitable a pickle.\n",
      "Sounding him carefully, Stubb further perceived that the Guernsey-man\n",
      "had not the slightest suspicion concerning the ambergris. He therefore\n",
      "held his peace on that head, but otherwise was quite frank and\n",
      "confidential with him, so that the two quickly concocted a little plan\n",
      "for both circumventing and satirizing the Captain, without his at all\n",
      "dreaming of distrusting their sincerity. According to this little plan\n",
      "of theirs, the Guernsey-man, under cover of an interpreter’s office,\n",
      "was to tell the Captain what he pleased, but as coming from Stubb; and\n",
      "as for Stubb, he was to utter any nonsense that should come uppermost\n",
      "in him during the interview.\n",
      "\n",
      "By this time their destined victim appeared from his cabin. He was a\n",
      "small and dark, but rather delicate looking man for a sea-captain, with\n",
      "large whiskers and moustache, however; and wore a red cotton velvet\n",
      "vest with watch-seals at his side. To this gentleman, Stubb was now\n",
      "politely introduced by the Guernsey-man, who at once ostentatiously put\n",
      "on the aspect of interpreting between them.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What shall I say to him first?” said he.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why,” said Stubb, eyeing the velvet vest and the watch and seals, “you\n",
      "may as well begin by telling him that he looks a sort of babyish to me,\n",
      "though I don’t pretend to be a judge.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“He says, Monsieur,” said the Guernsey-man, in French, turning to his\n",
      "captain, “that only yesterday his ship spoke a vessel, whose captain\n",
      "and chief-mate, with six sailors, had all died of a fever caught from a\n",
      "blasted whale they had brought alongside.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Upon this the captain started, and eagerly desired to know more.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What now?” said the Guernsey-man to Stubb.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why, since he takes it so easy, tell him that now I have eyed him\n",
      "carefully, I’m quite certain that he’s no more fit to command a\n",
      "whale-ship than a St. Jago monkey. In fact, tell him from me he’s a\n",
      "baboon.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“He vows and declares, Monsieur, that the other whale, the dried one,\n",
      "is far more deadly than the blasted one; in fine, Monsieur, he conjures\n",
      "us, as we value our lives, to cut loose from these fish.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Instantly the captain ran forward, and in a loud voice commanded his\n",
      "crew to desist from hoisting the cutting-tackles, and at once cast\n",
      "loose the cables and chains confining the whales to the ship.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What now?” said the Guernsey-man, when the Captain had returned to\n",
      "them.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why, let me see; yes, you may as well tell him now that—that—in fact,\n",
      "tell him I’ve diddled him, and (aside to himself) perhaps somebody\n",
      "else.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“He says, Monsieur, that he’s very happy to have been of any service to\n",
      "us.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Hearing this, the captain vowed that they were the grateful parties\n",
      "(meaning himself and mate) and concluded by inviting Stubb down into\n",
      "his cabin to drink a bottle of Bordeaux.\n",
      "\n",
      "“He wants you to take a glass of wine with him,” said the interpreter.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Thank him heartily; but tell him it’s against my principles to drink\n",
      "with the man I’ve diddled. In fact, tell him I must go.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“He says, Monsieur, that his principles won’t admit of his drinking;\n",
      "but that if Monsieur wants to live another day to drink, then Monsieur\n",
      "had best drop all four boats, and pull the ship away from these whales,\n",
      "for it’s so calm they won’t drift.”\n",
      "\n",
      "By this time Stubb was over the side, and getting into his boat, hailed\n",
      "the Guernsey-man to this effect,—that having a long tow-line in his\n",
      "boat, he would do what he could to help them, by pulling out the\n",
      "lighter whale of the two from the ship’s side. While the Frenchman’s\n",
      "boats, then, were engaged in towing the ship one way, Stubb\n",
      "benevolently towed away at his whale the other way, ostentatiously\n",
      "slacking out a most unusually long tow-line.\n",
      "\n",
      "Presently a breeze sprang up; Stubb feigned to cast off from the whale;\n",
      "hoisting his boats, the Frenchman soon increased his distance, while\n",
      "the Pequod slid in between him and Stubb’s whale. Whereupon Stubb\n",
      "quickly pulled to the floating body, and hailing the Pequod to give\n",
      "notice of his intentions, at once proceeded to reap the fruit of his\n",
      "unrighteous cunning. Seizing his sharp boat-spade, he commenced an\n",
      "excavation in the body, a little behind the side fin. You would almost\n",
      "have thought he was digging a cellar there in the sea; and when at\n",
      "length his spade struck against the gaunt ribs, it was like turning up\n",
      "old Roman tiles and pottery buried in fat English loam. His boat’s crew\n",
      "were all in high excitement, eagerly helping their chief, and looking\n",
      "as anxious as gold-hunters.\n",
      "\n",
      "And all the time numberless fowls were diving, and ducking, and\n",
      "screaming, and yelling, and fighting around them. Stubb was beginning\n",
      "to look disappointed, especially as the horrible nosegay increased,\n",
      "when suddenly from out the very heart of this plague, there stole a\n",
      "faint stream of perfume, which flowed through the tide of bad smells\n",
      "without being absorbed by it, as one river will flow into and then\n",
      "along with another, without at all blending with it for a time.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have it, I have it,” cried Stubb, with delight, striking something\n",
      "in the subterranean regions, “a purse! a purse!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Dropping his spade, he thrust both hands in, and drew out handfuls of\n",
      "something that looked like ripe Windsor soap, or rich mottled old\n",
      "cheese; very unctuous and savory withal. You might easily dent it with\n",
      "your thumb; it is of a hue between yellow and ash colour. And this,\n",
      "good friends, is ambergris, worth a gold guinea an ounce to any\n",
      "druggist. Some six handfuls were obtained; but more was unavoidably\n",
      "lost in the sea, and still more, perhaps, might have been secured were\n",
      "it not for impatient Ahab’s loud command to Stubb to desist, and come\n",
      "on board, else the ship would bid them good bye.\n",

      "CHAPTER 92. Ambergris.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now this ambergris is a very curious substance, and so important as an\n",
      "article of commerce, that in 1791 a certain Nantucket-born Captain\n",
      "Coffin was examined at the bar of the English House of Commons on that\n",
      "subject. For at that time, and indeed until a comparatively late day,\n",
      "the precise origin of ambergris remained, like amber itself, a problem\n",
      "to the learned. Though the word ambergris is but the French compound\n",
      "for grey amber, yet the two substances are quite distinct. For amber,\n",
      "though at times found on the sea-coast, is also dug up in some far\n",
      "inland soils, whereas ambergris is never found except upon the sea.\n",
      "Besides, amber is a hard, transparent, brittle, odorless substance,\n",
      "used for mouth-pieces to pipes, for beads and ornaments; but ambergris\n",
      "is soft, waxy, and so highly fragrant and spicy, that it is largely\n",
      "used in perfumery, in pastiles, precious candles, hair-powders, and\n",
      "pomatum. The Turks use it in cooking, and also carry it to Mecca, for\n",
      "the same purpose that frankincense is carried to St. Peter’s in Rome.\n",
      "Some wine merchants drop a few grains into claret, to flavor it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Who would think, then, that such fine ladies and gentlemen should\n",
      "regale themselves with an essence found in the inglorious bowels of a\n",
      "sick whale! Yet so it is. By some, ambergris is supposed to be the\n",
      "cause, and by others the effect, of the dyspepsia in the whale. How to\n",
      "cure such a dyspepsia it were hard to say, unless by administering\n",
      "three or four boat loads of Brandreth’s pills, and then running out of\n",
      "harm’s way, as laborers do in blasting rocks.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have forgotten to say that there were found in this ambergris,\n",
      "certain hard, round, bony plates, which at first Stubb thought might be\n",
      "sailors’ trowsers buttons; but it afterwards turned out that they were\n",
      "nothing more than pieces of small squid bones embalmed in that manner.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now that the incorruption of this most fragrant ambergris should be\n",
      "found in the heart of such decay; is this nothing? Bethink thee of that\n",
      "saying of St. Paul in Corinthians, about corruption and incorruption;\n",
      "how that we are sown in dishonor, but raised in glory. And likewise\n",
      "call to mind that saying of Paracelsus about what it is that maketh the\n",
      "best musk. Also forget not the strange fact that of all things of\n",
      "ill-savor, Cologne-water, in its rudimental manufacturing stages, is\n",
      "the worst.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should like to conclude the chapter with the above appeal, but\n",
      "cannot, owing to my anxiety to repel a charge often made against\n",
      "whalemen, and which, in the estimation of some already biased minds,\n",
      "might be considered as indirectly substantiated by what has been said\n",
      "of the Frenchman’s two whales. Elsewhere in this volume the slanderous\n",
      "aspersion has been disproved, that the vocation of whaling is\n",
      "throughout a slatternly, untidy business. But there is another thing to\n",
      "rebut. They hint that all whales always smell bad. Now how did this\n",
      "odious stigma originate?\n",
      "\n",
      "I opine, that it is plainly traceable to the first arrival of the\n",
      "Greenland whaling ships in London, more than two centuries ago. Because\n",
      "those whalemen did not then, and do not now, try out their oil at sea\n",
      "as the Southern ships have always done; but cutting up the fresh\n",
      "blubber in small bits, thrust it through the bung holes of large casks,\n",
      "and carry it home in that manner; the shortness of the season in those\n",
      "Icy Seas, and the sudden and violent storms to which they are exposed,\n",
      "forbidding any other course. The consequence is, that upon breaking\n",
      "into the hold, and unloading one of these whale cemeteries, in the\n",
      "Greenland dock, a savor is given forth somewhat similar to that arising\n",
      "from excavating an old city grave-yard, for the foundations of a\n",
      "Lying-in Hospital.\n",
      "\n",
      "I partly surmise also, that this wicked charge against whalers may be\n",
      "likewise imputed to the existence on the coast of Greenland, in former\n",
      "times, of a Dutch village called Schmerenburgh or Smeerenberg, which\n",
      "latter name is the one used by the learned Fogo Von Slack, in his great\n",
      "work on Smells, a text-book on that subject. As its name imports\n",
      "(smeer, fat; berg, to put up), this village was founded in order to\n",
      "afford a place for the blubber of the Dutch whale fleet to be tried\n",
      "out, without being taken home to Holland for that purpose. It was a\n",
      "collection of furnaces, fat-kettles, and oil sheds; and when the works\n",
      "were in full operation certainly gave forth no very pleasant savor. But\n",
      "all this is quite different with a South Sea Sperm Whaler; which in a\n",
      "voyage of four years perhaps, after completely filling her hold with\n",
      "oil, does not, perhaps, consume fifty days in the business of boiling\n",
      "out; and in the state that it is casked, the oil is nearly scentless.\n",
      "The truth is, that living or dead, if but decently treated, whales as a\n",
      "species are by no means creatures of ill odor; nor can whalemen be\n",
      "recognised, as the people of the middle ages affected to detect a Jew\n",
      "in the company, by the nose. Nor indeed can the whale possibly be\n",
      "otherwise than fragrant, when, as a general thing, he enjoys such high\n",
      "health; taking abundance of exercise; always out of doors; though, it\n",
      "is true, seldom in the open air. I say, that the motion of a Sperm\n",
      "Whale’s flukes above water dispenses a perfume, as when a musk-scented\n",
      "lady rustles her dress in a warm parlor. What then shall I liken the\n",
      "Sperm Whale to for fragrance, considering his magnitude? Must it not be\n",
      "to that famous elephant, with jewelled tusks, and redolent with myrrh,\n",

      "It was but some few days after encountering the Frenchman, that a most\n",

      "an event most lamentable; and which ended in providing the sometimes\n",

      "the green; and at melodious even-tide, with his gay ha-ha! had turned\n",
      "the round horizon into one star-belled tambourine. So, though in the\n",
      "clear air of day, suspended against a blue-veined neck, the\n",
      "pure-watered diamond drop will healthful glow; yet, when the cunning\n",
      "jeweller would show you the diamond in its most impressive lustre, he\n",
      "lays it against a gloomy ground, and then lights it up, not by the sun,\n",
      "but by some unnatural gases. Then come out those fiery effulgences,\n",
      "infernally superb; then the evil-blazing diamond, once the divinest\n",
      "symbol of the crystal skies, looks like some crown-jewel stolen from\n",
      "the King of Hell. But let us to the story.\n",
      "\n",
      "It came to pass, that in the ambergris affair Stubb’s after-oarsman\n",
      "chanced so to sprain his hand, as for a time to become quite maimed;\n",
      "and, temporarily, Pip was put into his place.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first time Stubb lowered with him, Pip evinced much nervousness;\n",
      "but happily, for that time, escaped close contact with the whale; and\n",
      "therefore came off not altogether discreditably; though Stubb observing\n",
      "him, took care, afterwards, to exhort him to cherish his courageousness\n",
      "to the utmost, for he might often find it needful.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now upon the second lowering, the boat paddled upon the whale; and as\n",
      "the fish received the darted iron, it gave its customary rap, which\n",
      "happened, in this instance, to be right under poor Pip’s seat. The\n",
      "involuntary consternation of the moment caused him to leap, paddle in\n",
      "hand, out of the boat; and in such a way, that part of the slack whale\n",
      "line coming against his chest, he breasted it overboard with him, so as\n",
      "to become entangled in it, when at last plumping into the water. That\n",
      "instant the stricken whale started on a fierce run, the line swiftly\n",
      "straightened; and presto! poor Pip came all foaming up to the chocks of\n",
      "the boat, remorselessly dragged there by the line, which had taken\n",
      "several turns around his chest and neck.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tashtego stood in the bows. He was full of the fire of the hunt. He\n",
      "hated Pip for a poltroon. Snatching the boat-knife from its sheath, he\n",
      "suspended its sharp edge over the line, and turning towards Stubb,\n",
      "exclaimed interrogatively, “Cut?” Meantime Pip’s blue, choked face\n",
      "plainly looked, Do, for God’s sake! All passed in a flash. In less than\n",
      "half a minute, this entire thing happened.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Damn him, cut!” roared Stubb; and so the whale was lost and Pip was\n",
      "saved.\n",
      "\n",
      "So soon as he recovered himself, the poor little negro was assailed by\n",
      "yells and execrations from the crew. Tranquilly permitting these\n",
      "irregular cursings to evaporate, Stubb then in a plain, business-like,\n",
      "but still half humorous manner, cursed Pip officially; and that done,\n",
      "unofficially gave him much wholesome advice. The substance was, Never\n",
      "jump from a boat, Pip, except—but all the rest was indefinite, as the\n",
      "soundest advice ever is. Now, in general, _Stick to the boat_, is your\n",
      "true motto in whaling; but cases will sometimes happen when _Leap from\n",
      "the boat_, is still better. Moreover, as if perceiving at last that if\n",
      "he should give undiluted conscientious advice to Pip, he would be\n",
      "leaving him too wide a margin to jump in for the future; Stubb suddenly\n",
      "dropped all advice, and concluded with a peremptory command, “Stick to\n",
      "the boat, Pip, or by the Lord, I won’t pick you up if you jump; mind\n",
      "that. We can’t afford to lose whales by the likes of you; a whale would\n",
      "sell for thirty times what you would, Pip, in Alabama. Bear that in\n",
      "mind, and don’t jump any more.” Hereby perhaps Stubb indirectly hinted,\n",
      "that though man loved his fellow, yet man is a money-making animal,\n",
      "which propensity too often interferes with his benevolence.\n",
      "\n",
      "But we are all in the hands of the Gods; and Pip jumped again. It was\n",
      "under very similar circumstances to the first performance; but this\n",
      "time he did not breast out the line; and hence, when the whale started\n",
      "to run, Pip was left behind on the sea, like a hurried traveller’s\n",
      "trunk. Alas! Stubb was but too true to his word. It was a beautiful,\n",
      "bounteous, blue day; the spangled sea calm and cool, and flatly\n",
      "stretching away, all round, to the horizon, like gold-beater’s skin\n",
      "hammered out to the extremest. Bobbing up and down in that sea, Pip’s\n",
      "ebon head showed like a head of cloves. No boat-knife was lifted when\n",
      "he fell so rapidly astern. Stubb’s inexorable back was turned upon him;\n",
      "and the whale was winged. In three minutes, a whole mile of shoreless\n",
      "ocean was between Pip and Stubb. Out from the centre of the sea, poor\n",
      "Pip turned his crisp, curling, black head to the sun, another lonely\n",
      "castaway, though the loftiest and the brightest.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, in calm weather, to swim in the open ocean is as easy to the\n",
      "practised swimmer as to ride in a spring-carriage ashore. But the awful\n",
      "lonesomeness is intolerable. The intense concentration of self in the\n",
      "middle of such a heartless immensity, my God! who can tell it? Mark,\n",
      "how when sailors in a dead calm bathe in the open sea—mark how closely\n",
      "they hug their ship and only coast along her sides.\n",
      "\n",
      "But had Stubb really abandoned the poor little negro to his fate? No;\n",
      "he did not mean to, at least. Because there were two boats in his wake,\n",
      "and he supposed, no doubt, that they would of course come up to Pip\n",
      "very quickly, and pick him up; though, indeed, such considerations\n",
      "towards oarsmen jeopardized through their own timidity, is not always\n",
      "manifested by the hunters in all similar instances; and such instances\n",
      "not unfrequently occur; almost invariably in the fishery, a coward, so\n",
      "called, is marked with the same ruthless detestation peculiar to\n",
      "military navies and armies.\n",
      "\n",
      "But it so happened, that those boats, without seeing Pip, suddenly\n",
      "spying whales close to them on one side, turned, and gave chase; and\n",
      "Stubb’s boat was now so far away, and he and all his crew so intent\n",
      "upon his fish, that Pip’s ringed horizon began to expand around him\n",
      "miserably. By the merest chance the ship itself at last rescued him;\n",
      "but from that hour the little negro went about the deck an idiot; such,\n",
      "at least, they said he was. The sea had jeeringly kept his finite body\n",
      "up, but drowned the infinite of his soul. Not drowned entirely, though.\n",
      "Rather carried down alive to wondrous depths, where strange shapes of\n",
      "the unwarped primal world glided to and fro before his passive eyes;\n",
      "and the miser-merman, Wisdom, revealed his hoarded heaps; and among the\n",
      "joyous, heartless, ever-juvenile eternities, Pip saw the multitudinous,\n",
      "God-omnipresent, coral insects, that out of the firmament of waters\n",
      "heaved the colossal orbs. He saw God’s foot upon the treadle of the\n",
      "loom, and spoke it; and therefore his shipmates called him mad. So\n",
      "man’s insanity is heaven’s sense; and wandering from all mortal reason,\n",
      "man comes at last to that celestial thought, which, to reason, is\n",
      "absurd and frantic; and weal or woe, feels then uncompromised,\n",
      "indifferent as his God.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the rest, blame not Stubb too hardly. The thing is common in that\n",

      "\n",
      "First comes white-horse, so called, which is obtained from the tapering\n",
      "part of the fish, and also from the thicker portions of his flukes. It\n",
      "is tough with congealed tendons—a wad of muscle—but still contains some\n",
      "oil. After being severed from the whale, the white-horse is first cut\n",

      "whale’s flesh, here and there adhering to the blanket of blubber, and\n",
      "often participating to a considerable degree in its unctuousness. It is\n",
      "a most refreshing, convivial, beautiful object to behold. As its name\n",
      "imports, it is of an exceedingly rich, mottled tint, with a bestreaked\n",
      "snowy and golden ground, dotted with spots of the deepest crimson and\n",
      "purple. It is plums of rubies, in pictures of citron. Spite of reason,\n",
      "it is hard to keep yourself from eating it. I confess, that once I\n",

      "There is another substance, and a very singular one, which turns up in\n",

      "adequately to describe. It is called slobgollion; an appellation\n",
      "original with the whalemen, and even so is the nature of the substance.\n",
      "It is an ineffably oozy, stringy affair, most frequently found in the\n",

      "Gurry, so called, is a term properly belonging to right whalemen, but\n",

      "inferior souls who hunt that ignoble Leviathan.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nippers. Strictly this word is not indigenous to the whale’s\n",
      "vocabulary. But as applied by whalemen, it becomes so. A whaleman’s\n",
      "nipper is a short firm strip of tendinous stuff cut from the tapering\n",
      "part of Leviathan’s tail: it averages an inch in thickness, and for the\n",
      "rest, is about the size of the iron part of a hoe. Edgewise moved along\n",

      "whaling-pike is similar to a frigate’s boarding-weapon of the same\n",

      "gaffman hooks on to a sheet of blubber, and strives to hold it from\n",
      "slipping, as the ship pitches and lurches about. Meanwhile, the\n",
      "spade-man stands on the sheet itself, perpendicularly chopping it into\n",
      "the portable horse-pieces. This spade is sharp as hone can make it; the\n",

      "\n",
      "“All ready there? Off hatch, then, and start her. You cook, fire the\n",
      "works.” This was an easy thing, for the carpenter had been thrusting\n",
      "his shavings into the furnace throughout the passage. Here be it said\n",
      "that in a whaling voyage the first fire in the try-works has to be fed\n",
      "for a time with wood. After that no wood is used, except as a means of\n",
      "quick ignition to the staple fuel. In a word, after being tried out,\n",
      "the crisp, shrivelled blubber, now called scraps or fritters, still\n",
      "contains considerable of its unctuous properties. These fritters feed\n",
      "the flames. Like a plethoric burning martyr, or a self-consuming\n",
      "misanthrope, once ignited, the whale supplies his own fuel and burns by\n",
      "his own body. Would that he consumed his own smoke! for his smoke is\n",
      "horrible to inhale, and inhale it you must, and not only that, but you\n",
      "must live in it for the time. It has an unspeakable, wild, Hindoo odor\n",
      "about it, such as may lurk in the vicinity of funereal pyres. It smells\n",

      "flames, which at intervals forked forth from the sooty flues, and\n",
      "illuminated every lofty rope in the rigging, as with the famed Greek\n",
      "fire. The burning ship drove on, as if remorselessly commissioned to\n",
      "some vengeful deed. So the pitch and sulphur-freighted brigs of the\n",

      "\n",
      "The hatch, removed from the top of the works, now afforded a wide\n",
      "hearth in front of them. Standing on this were the Tartarean shapes of\n",
      "the pagan harpooneers, always the whale-ship’s stokers. With huge\n",

      "curling, out of the doors to catch them by the feet. The smoke rolled\n",
      "away in sullen heaps. To every pitch of the ship there was a pitch of\n",
      "the boiling oil, which seemed all eagerness to leap into their faces.\n",
      "Opposite the mouth of the works, on the further side of the wide wooden\n",
      "hearth, was the windlass. This served for a sea-sofa. Here lounged the\n",
      "watch, when not otherwise employed, looking into the red heat of the\n",
      "fire, till their eyes felt scorched in their heads. Their tawny\n",
      "features, now all begrimed with smoke and sweat, their matted beards,\n",
      "and the contrasting barbaric brilliancy of their teeth, all these were\n",
      "strangely revealed in the capricious emblazonings of the works. As they\n",
      "narrated to each other their unholy adventures, their tales of terror\n",
      "told in words of mirth; as their uncivilized laughter forked upwards\n",
      "out of them, like the flames from the furnace; as to and fro, in their\n",
      "front, the harpooneers wildly gesticulated with their huge pronged\n",
      "forks and dippers; as the wind howled on, and the sea leaped, and the\n",
      "ship groaned and dived, and yet steadfastly shot her red hell further\n",
      "and further into the blackness of the sea and the night, and scornfully\n",
      "champed the white bone in her mouth, and viciously spat round her on\n",
      "all sides; then the rushing Pequod, freighted with savages, and laden\n",
      "with fire, and burning a corpse, and plunging into that blackness of\n",
      "darkness, seemed the material counterpart of her monomaniac commander’s\n",

      "So seemed it to me, as I stood at her helm, and for long hours silently\n",
      "guided the way of this fire-ship on the sea. Wrapped, for that\n",
      "interval, in darkness myself, I but the better saw the redness, the\n",
      "madness, the ghastliness of others. The continual sight of the fiend\n",
      "shapes before me, capering half in smoke and half in fire, these at\n",

      "But that night, in particular, a strange (and ever since inexplicable)\n",
      "thing occurred to me. Starting from a brief standing sleep, I was\n",
      "horribly conscious of something fatally wrong. The jaw-bone tiller\n",
      "smote my side, which leaned against it; in my ears was the low hum of\n",
      "sails, just beginning to shake in the wind; I thought my eyes were\n",
      "open; I was half conscious of putting my fingers to the lids and\n",
      "mechanically stretching them still further apart. But, spite of all\n",
      "this, I could see no compass before me to steer by; though it seemed\n",
      "but a minute since I had been watching the card, by the steady binnacle\n",
      "lamp illuminating it. Nothing seemed before me but a jet gloom, now and\n",
      "then made ghastly by flashes of redness. Uppermost was the impression,\n",
      "that whatever swift, rushing thing I stood on was not so much bound to\n",
      "any haven ahead as rushing from all havens astern. A stark, bewildered\n",
      "feeling, as of death, came over me. Convulsively my hands grasped the\n",
      "tiller, but with the crazy conceit that the tiller was, somehow, in\n",
      "some enchanted way, inverted. My God! what is the matter with me?\n",
      "thought I. Lo! in my brief sleep I had turned myself about, and was\n",
      "fronting the ship’s stern, with my back to her prow and the compass. In\n",
      "an instant I faced back, just in time to prevent the vessel from flying\n",
      "up into the wind, and very probably capsizing her. How glad and how\n",
      "grateful the relief from this unnatural hallucination of the night, and\n",
      "the fatal contingency of being brought by the lee!\n",
      "\n",
      "Look not too long in the face of the fire, O man! Never dream with thy\n",
      "hand on the helm! Turn not thy back to the compass; accept the first\n",
      "hint of the hitching tiller; believe not the artificial fire, when its\n",

      "\n",
      "In less than a minute, without quitting his little craft, he and his\n",
      "crew were dropped to the water, and were soon alongside of the\n",
      "stranger. But here a curious difficulty presented itself. In the\n",
      "excitement of the moment, Ahab had forgotten that since the loss of his\n",
      "leg he had never once stepped on board of any vessel at sea but his\n",
      "own, and then it was always by an ingenious and very handy mechanical\n",
      "contrivance peculiar to the Pequod, and a thing not to be rigged and\n",

      "easy matter for anybody—except those who are almost hourly used to it,\n",
      "like whalemen—to clamber up a ship’s side from a boat on the open sea;\n",
      "for the great swells now lift the boat high up towards the bulwarks,\n",
      "and then instantaneously drop it half way down to the kelson. So,\n",
      "deprived of one leg, and the strange ship of course being altogether\n",
      "unsupplied with the kindly invention, Ahab now found himself abjectly\n",
      "reduced to a clumsy landsman again; hopelessly eyeing the uncertain\n",
      "changeful height he could hardly hope to attain.\n",
      "\n",
      "It has before been hinted, perhaps, that every little untoward\n",
      "circumstance that befell him, and which indirectly sprang from his\n",
      "luckless mishap, almost invariably irritated or exasperated Ahab. And\n",
      "in the present instance, all this was heightened by the sight of the\n",
      "two officers of the strange ship, leaning over the side, by the\n",
      "perpendicular ladder of nailed cleets there, and swinging towards him a\n",
      "pair of tastefully-ornamented man-ropes; for at first they did not seem\n",
      "to bethink them that a one-legged man must be too much of a cripple to\n",
      "use their sea bannisters. But this awkwardness only lasted a minute,\n",
      "because the strange captain, observing at a glance how affairs stood,\n",
      "cried out, “I see, I see!—avast heaving there! Jump, boys, and swing\n",
      "over the cutting-tackle.”\n",
      "\n",
      "As good luck would have it, they had had a whale alongside a day or two\n",
      "previous, and the great tackles were still aloft, and the massive\n",
      "curved blubber-hook, now clean and dry, was still attached to the end.\n",
      "This was quickly lowered to Ahab, who at once comprehending it all,\n",
      "slid his solitary thigh into the curve of the hook (it was like sitting\n",
      "in the fluke of an anchor, or the crotch of an apple tree), and then\n",
      "giving the word, held himself fast, and at the same time also helped to\n",
      "hoist his own weight, by pulling hand-over-hand upon one of the running\n",
      "parts of the tackle. Soon he was carefully swung inside the high\n",
      "bulwarks, and gently landed upon the capstan head. With his ivory arm\n",
      "frankly thrust forth in welcome, the other captain advanced, and Ahab,\n",
      "putting out his ivory leg, and crossing the ivory arm (like two\n",
      "sword-fish blades) cried out in his walrus way, “Aye, aye, hearty! let\n",
      "us shake bones together!—an arm and a leg!—an arm that never can\n",

      "fastened to one of them; a regular circus horse he was, too, that went\n",
      "milling and milling round so, that my boat’s crew could only trim dish,\n",
      "by sitting all their sterns on the outer gunwale. Presently up breaches\n",

      "“And harpoons sticking in near his starboard fin.”\n",

      "somehow; but we didn’t know it then; so that when we afterwards pulled\n",
      "on the line, bounce we came plump on to his hump! instead of the other\n",
      "whale’s; that went off to windward, all fluking. Seeing how matters\n",
      "stood, and what a noble great whale it was—the noblest and biggest I\n",
      "ever saw, sir, in my life—I resolved to capture him, spite of the\n",
      "boiling rage he seemed to be in. And thinking the hap-hazard line would\n",
      "get loose, or the tooth it was tangled to might draw (for I have a\n",
      "devil of a boat’s crew for a pull on a whale-line); seeing all this, I\n",

      "looming straight up out of it, perpendicular in the air, like a marble\n",
      "steeple. No use sterning all, then; but as I was groping at midday,\n",

      "flukes first, the white hump backed through the wreck, as though it was\n",
      "all chips. We all struck out. To escape his terrible flailings, I\n",
      "seized hold of my harpoon-pole sticking in him, and for a moment clung\n",
      "to that like a sucking fish. But a combing sea dashed me off, and at\n",
      "the same instant, the fish, taking one good dart forwards, went down\n",
      "like a flash; and the barb of that cursed second iron towing along near\n",
      "me caught me here” (clapping his hand just below his shoulder); “yes,\n",
      "caught me just here, I say, and bore me down to Hell’s flames, I was\n",
      "thinking; when, when, all of a sudden, thank the good God, the barb\n",

      "fish. 550,000 lbs. of biscuit. 72,000 lbs. of soft bread. 2,800 firkins\n",
      "of butter. 20,000 lbs. Texel & Leyden cheese. 144,000 lbs. cheese\n",

      "the present case, however, where the reader is flooded with whole\n",
      "pipes, barrels, quarts, and gills of good gin and good cheer.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the time, I devoted three days to the studious digesting of all this\n",
      "beer, beef, and bread, during which many profound thoughts were\n",
      "incidentally suggested to me, capable of a transcendental and Platonic\n",
      "application; and, furthermore, I compiled supplementary tables of my\n",
      "own, touching the probable quantity of stock-fish, etc., consumed by\n",
      "every Low Dutch harpooneer in that ancient Greenland and Spitzbergen\n",
      "whale fishery. In the first place, the amount of butter, and Texel and\n",
      "Leyden cheese consumed, seems amazing. I impute it, though, to their\n",
      "naturally unctuous natures, being rendered still more unctuous by the\n",
      "nature of their vocation, and especially by their pursuing their game\n",

      "train oil.\n",

      "The quantity of beer, too, is very large, 10,800 barrels. Now, as those\n",
      "polar fisheries could only be prosecuted in the short summer of that\n",
      "climate, so that the whole cruise of one of these Dutch whalemen,\n",
      "including the short voyage to and from the Spitzbergen sea, did not\n",
      "much exceed three months, say, and reckoning 30 men to each of their\n",

      "say, we have precisely two barrels of beer per man, for a twelve weeks’\n",
      "allowance, exclusive of his fair proportion of that 550 ankers of gin.\n",
      "Now, whether these gin and beer harpooneers, so fuddled as one might\n",
      "fancy them to have been, were the right sort of men to stand up in a\n",
      "boat’s head, and take good aim at flying whales; this would seem\n",
      "somewhat improbable. Yet they did aim at them, and hit them too. But\n",

      "we are briefly to exhibit. Such a statement may prove useful here.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to a careful calculation I have made, and which I partly base\n",
      "upon Captain Scoresby’s estimate, of seventy tons for the largest sized\n",
      "Greenland whale of sixty feet in length; according to my careful\n",
      "calculation, I say, a Sperm Whale of the largest magnitude, between\n",
      "eighty-five and ninety feet in length, and something less than forty\n",
      "feet in its fullest circumference, such a whale will weigh at least\n",
      "ninety tons; so that, reckoning thirteen men to a ton, he would\n",
      "considerably outweigh the combined population of a whole village of one\n",
      "thousand one hundred inhabitants.\n",
      "\n",
      "Think you not then that brains, like yoked cattle, should be put to\n",
      "this leviathan, to make him at all budge to any landsman’s imagination?\n",
      "\n",
      "Having already in various ways put before you his skull, spout-hole,\n",
      "jaw, teeth, tail, forehead, fins, and divers other parts, I shall now\n",
      "simply point out what is most interesting in the general bulk of his\n",
      "unobstructed bones. But as the colossal skull embraces so very large a\n",
      "proportion of the entire extent of the skeleton; as it is by far the\n",
      "most complicated part; and as nothing is to be repeated concerning it\n",
      "in this chapter, you must not fail to carry it in your mind, or under\n",
      "your arm, as we proceed, otherwise you will not gain a complete notion\n",
      "of the general structure we are about to view.\n",
      "\n",
      "In length, the Sperm Whale’s skeleton at Tranque measured seventy-two\n",
      "feet; so that when fully invested and extended in life, he must have\n",
      "been ninety feet long; for in the whale, the skeleton loses about one\n",
      "fifth in length compared with the living body. Of this seventy-two\n",
      "feet, his skull and jaw comprised some twenty feet, leaving some fifty\n",
      "feet of plain back-bone. Attached to this back-bone, for something less\n",
      "than a third of its length, was the mighty circular basket of ribs\n",
      "which once enclosed his vitals.\n",
      "\n",
      "To me this vast ivory-ribbed chest, with the long, unrelieved spine,\n",
      "extending far away from it in a straight line, not a little resembled\n",
      "the hull of a great ship new-laid upon the stocks, when only some\n",
      "twenty of her naked bow-ribs are inserted, and the keel is otherwise,\n",
      "for the time, but a long, disconnected timber.\n",
      "\n",
      "The ribs were ten on a side. The first, to begin from the neck, was\n",
      "nearly six feet long; the second, third, and fourth were each\n",
      "successively longer, till you came to the climax of the fifth, or one\n",
      "of the middle ribs, which measured eight feet and some inches. From\n",
      "that part, the remaining ribs diminished, till the tenth and last only\n",
      "spanned five feet and some inches. In general thickness, they all bore\n",
      "a seemly correspondence to their length. The middle ribs were the most\n",
      "arched. In some of the Arsacides they are used for beams whereon to lay\n",
      "footpath bridges over small streams.\n",
      "\n",
      "In considering these ribs, I could not but be struck anew with the\n",
      "circumstance, so variously repeated in this book, that the skeleton of\n",
      "the whale is by no means the mould of his invested form. The largest of\n",
      "the Tranque ribs, one of the middle ones, occupied that part of the\n",
      "fish which, in life, is greatest in depth. Now, the greatest depth of\n",
      "the invested body of this particular whale must have been at least\n",
      "sixteen feet; whereas, the corresponding rib measured but little more\n",
      "than eight feet. So that this rib only conveyed half of the true notion\n",
      "of the living magnitude of that part. Besides, for some way, where I\n",
      "now saw but a naked spine, all that had been once wrapped round with\n",
      "tons of added bulk in flesh, muscle, blood, and bowels. Still more, for\n",
      "the ample fins, I here saw but a few disordered joints; and in place of\n",
      "the weighty and majestic, but boneless flukes, an utter blank!\n",
      "\n",
      "How vain and foolish, then, thought I, for timid untravelled man to try\n",
      "to comprehend aright this wondrous whale, by merely poring over his\n",
      "dead attenuated skeleton, stretched in this peaceful wood. No. Only in\n",
      "the heart of quickest perils; only when within the eddyings of his\n",
      "angry flukes; only on the profound unbounded sea, can the fully\n",
      "invested whale be truly and livingly found out.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the spine. For that, the best way we can consider it is, with a\n",
      "crane, to pile its bones high up on end. No speedy enterprise. But now\n",
      "it’s done, it looks much like Pompey’s Pillar.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are forty and odd vertebræ in all, which in the skeleton are not\n",
      "locked together. They mostly lie like the great knobbed blocks on a\n",
      "Gothic spire, forming solid courses of heavy masonry. The largest, a\n",
      "middle one, is in width something less than three feet, and in depth\n",
      "more than four. The smallest, where the spine tapers away into the\n",
      "tail, is only two inches in width, and looks something like a white\n",
      "billiard-ball. I was told that there were still smaller ones, but they\n",
      "had been lost by some little cannibal urchins, the priest’s children,\n",
      "who had stolen them to play marbles with. Thus we see how that the\n",

      "by some unknown, and seemingly inexplicable, unimaginable casualty, his\n",

      "the sweetest songster of the grove; so, equally with every felicity,\n",
      "all miserable events do naturally beget their like. Yea, more than\n",

      "for the other world, but, on the contrary, shall be followed by the\n",

      "\n",
      "Like all sea-going ship carpenters, and more especially those belonging\n",
      "to whaling vessels, he was, to a certain off-handed, practical extent,\n",
      "alike experienced in numerous trades and callings collateral to his\n",
      "own; the carpenter’s pursuit being the ancient and outbranching trunk\n",
      "of all those numerous handicrafts which more or less have to do with\n",
      "wood as an auxiliary material. But, besides the application to him of\n",

      "efficient in those thousand nameless mechanical emergencies continually\n",
      "recurring in a large ship, upon a three or four years’ voyage, in\n",
      "uncivilized and far-distant seas. For not to speak of his readiness in\n",
      "ordinary duties:—repairing stove boats, sprung spars, reforming the\n",
      "shape of clumsy-bladed oars, inserting bull’s eyes in the deck, or new\n",
      "tree-nails in the side planks, and other miscellaneous matters more\n",
      "directly pertaining to his special business; he was moreover\n",
      "unhesitatingly expert in all manner of conflicting aptitudes, both\n",
      "useful and capricious.\n",
      "\n",
      "The one grand stage where he enacted all his various parts so manifold,\n",
      "was his vice-bench; a long rude ponderous table furnished with several\n",
      "vices, of different sizes, and both of iron and of wood. At all times\n",
      "except when whales were alongside, this bench was securely lashed\n",

      "\n",
      "A belaying pin is found too large to be easily inserted into its hole:\n",
      "the carpenter claps it into one of his ever-ready vices, and\n",
      "straightway files it smaller. A lost land-bird of strange plumage\n",
      "strays on board, and is made a captive: out of clean shaved rods of\n",
      "right-whale bone, and cross-beams of sperm whale ivory, the carpenter\n",
      "makes a pagoda-looking cage for it. An oarsman sprains his wrist: the\n",
      "carpenter concocts a soothing lotion. Stubb longed for vermillion stars\n",
      "to be painted upon the blade of his every oar; screwing each oar in his\n",
      "big vice of wood, the carpenter symmetrically supplies the\n",
      "constellation. A sailor takes a fancy to wear shark-bone ear-rings: the\n",
      "carpenter drills his ears. Another has the toothache: the carpenter out\n",
      "pincers, and clapping one hand upon his bench bids him be seated there;\n",

      "signs him to clap his jaw in that, if he would have him draw the tooth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus, this carpenter was prepared at all points, and alike indifferent\n",
      "and without respect in all. Teeth he accounted bits of ivory; heads he\n",
      "deemed but top-blocks; men themselves he lightly held for capstans. But\n",
      "while now upon so wide a field thus variously accomplished and with\n",
      "such liveliness of expertness in him, too; all this would seem to argue\n",
      "some uncommon vivacity of intelligence. But not precisely so. For\n",
      "nothing was this man more remarkable, than for a certain impersonal\n",
      "stolidity as it were; impersonal, I say; for it so shaded off into the\n",
      "surrounding infinite of things, that it seemed one with the general\n",
      "stolidity discernible in the whole visible world; which while\n",
      "pauselessly active in uncounted modes, still eternally holds its peace,\n",
      "and ignores you, though you dig foundations for cathedrals. Yet was\n",
      "this half-horrible stolidity in him, involving, too, as it appeared, an\n",

      "now and then with a certain grizzled wittiness; such as might have\n",

      "gathered no moss; but what is more, had rubbed off whatever small\n",
      "outward clingings might have originally pertained to him? He was a\n",
      "stript abstract; an unfractioned integral; uncompromised as a new-born\n",
      "babe; living without premeditated reference to this world or the next.\n",
      "You might almost say, that this strange uncompromisedness in him\n",
      "involved a sort of unintelligence; for in his numerous trades, he did\n",
      "not seem to work so much by reason or by instinct, or simply because he\n",
      "had been tutored to it, or by any intermixture of all these, even or\n",
      "uneven; but merely by a kind of deaf and dumb, spontaneous literal\n",
      "process. He was a pure manipulator; his brain, if he had ever had one,\n",
      "must have early oozed along into the muscles of his fingers. He was\n",
      "like one of those unreasoning but still highly useful, _multum in\n",
      "parvo_, Sheffield contrivances, assuming the exterior—though a little\n",

      "\n",

      "ostentatiously handle his spokes, and the eager mariners quickly run to\n",
      "the braces, and would stand there with all their eyes centrally fixed\n",
      "on the nailed doubloon; impatient for the order to point the ship’s\n",
      "prow for the equator. In good time the order came. It was hard upon\n",
      "high noon; and Ahab, seated in the bows of his high-hoisted boat, was\n",
      "about taking his wonted daily observation of the sun to determine his\n",
      "latitude.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, in that Japanese sea, the days in summer are as freshets of\n",
      "effulgences. That unblinkingly vivid Japanese sun seems the blazing\n",
      "focus of the glassy ocean’s immeasurable burning-glass. The sky looks\n",
      "lacquered; clouds there are none; the horizon floats; and this\n",
      "nakedness of unrelieved radiance is as the insufferable splendors of\n",
      "God’s throne. Well that Ahab’s quadrant was furnished with coloured\n",
      "glasses, through which to take sight of that solar fire. So, swinging\n",
      "his seated form to the roll of the ship, and with his\n",
      "astrological-looking instrument placed to his eye, he remained in that\n",
      "posture for some moments to catch the precise instant when the sun\n",
      "should gain its precise meridian. Meantime while his whole attention\n",
      "was absorbed, the Parsee was kneeling beneath him on the ship’s deck,\n",
      "and with face thrown up like Ahab’s, was eyeing the same sun with him;\n",
      "only the lids of his eyes half hooded their orbs, and his wild face was\n",
      "subdued to an earthly passionlessness. At length the desired\n",
      "observation was taken; and with his pencil upon his ivory leg, Ahab\n",
      "soon calculated what his latitude must be at that precise instant. Then\n",
      "falling into a moment’s revery, he again looked up towards the sun and\n",
      "murmured to himself: “Thou sea-mark! thou high and mighty Pilot! thou\n",
      "tellest me truly where I _am_—but canst thou cast the least hint where\n",
      "I _shall_ be? Or canst thou tell where some other thing besides me is\n",
      "this moment living? Where is Moby Dick? This instant thou must be\n",
      "eyeing him. These eyes of mine look into the very eye that is even now\n",
      "beholding him; aye, and into the eye that is even now equally beholding\n",
      "the objects on the unknown, thither side of thee, thou sun!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then gazing at his quadrant, and handling, one after the other, its\n",
      "numerous cabalistical contrivances, he pondered again, and muttered:\n",
      "“Foolish toy! babies’ plaything of haughty Admirals, and Commodores,\n",
      "and Captains; the world brags of thee, of thy cunning and might; but\n",
      "what after all canst thou do, but tell the poor, pitiful point, where\n",
      "thou thyself happenest to be on this wide planet, and the hand that\n",
      "holds thee: no! not one jot more! Thou canst not tell where one drop of\n",
      "water or one grain of sand will be to-morrow noon; and yet with thy\n",
      "impotence thou insultest the sun! Science! Curse thee, thou vain toy;\n",
      "and cursed be all the things that cast man’s eyes aloft to that heaven,\n",
      "whose live vividness but scorches him, as these old eyes are even now\n",
      "scorched with thy light, O sun! Level by nature to this earth’s horizon\n",
      "are the glances of man’s eyes; not shot from the crown of his head, as\n",
      "if God had meant him to gaze on his firmament. Curse thee, thou\n",

      "log and by line; _these_ shall conduct me, and show me my place on the\n",
      "sea. Aye,” lighting from the boat to the deck, “thus I trample on thee,\n",
      "thou paltry thing that feebly pointest on high; thus I split and\n",

      "dead feet, a sneering triumph that seemed meant for Ahab, and a\n",
      "fatalistic despair that seemed meant for himself—these passed over the\n",
      "mute, motionless Parsee’s face. Unobserved he rose and glided away;\n",
      "while, awestruck by the aspect of their commander, the seamen clustered\n",
      "together on the forecastle, till Ahab, troubledly pacing the deck,\n",
      "shouted out—“To the braces! Up helm!—square in!”\n",

      "flames on his body.\n",
      "\n",
      "The tableau all waned at last with the pallidness aloft; and once more\n",
      "the Pequod and every soul on her decks were wrapped in a pall. A moment\n",
      "or two passed, when Starbuck, going forward, pushed against some one.\n",
      "It was Stubb. “What thinkest thou now, man; I heard thy cry; it was not\n",

      "they no bowels for a laugh? And look ye, Mr. Starbuck—but it’s too dark\n",
      "to look. Hear me, then: I take that mast-head flame we saw for a sign\n",
      "of good luck; for those masts are rooted in a hold that is going to be\n",
      "chock a’ block with sperm-oil, d’ye see; and so, all that sperm will\n",
      "work up into the masts, like sap in a tree. Yes, our three masts will\n",
      "yet be as three spermaceti candles—that’s the good promise we saw.”\n",
      "\n",
      "At that moment Starbuck caught sight of Stubb’s face slowly beginning\n",
      "to glimmer into sight. Glancing upwards, he cried: “See! see!” and once\n",
      "more the high tapering flames were beheld with what seemed redoubled\n",
      "supernaturalness in their pallor.\n",

      "they had just been engaged securing a spar, a number of the seamen,\n",
      "arrested by the glare, now cohered together, and hung pendulous, like a\n",
      "knot of numbed wasps from a drooping, orchard twig. In various\n",
      "enchanted attitudes, like the standing, or stepping, or running\n",

      "perch, Starbuck being the one who secured the rope at last; and\n",
      "afterwards stood near it. And thus, with one hand clinging round the\n",
      "royal mast, Ahab gazed abroad upon the sea for miles and miles,—ahead,\n",

      "the rigging, which chances to afford no foothold, the sailor at sea is\n",
      "hoisted up to that spot, and sustained there by the rope; under these\n",
      "circumstances, its fastened end on deck is always given in strict\n",
      "charge to some one man who has the special watch of it. Because in such\n",
      "a wilderness of running rigging, whose various different relations\n",
      "aloft cannot always be infallibly discerned by what is seen of them at\n",
      "the deck; and when the deck-ends of these ropes are being every few\n",
      "minutes cast down from the fastenings, it would be but a natural\n",
      "fatality, if, unprovided with a constant watchman, the hoisted sailor\n",
      "should by some carelessness of the crew be cast adrift and fall all\n",
      "swooping to the sea. So Ahab’s proceedings in this matter were not\n",
      "unusual; the only strange thing about them seemed to be, that Starbuck,\n",
      "almost the one only man who had ever ventured to oppose him with\n",
      "anything in the slightest degree approaching to decision—one of those\n",
      "too, whose faithfulness on the look-out he had seemed to doubt\n",
      "somewhat;—it was strange, that this was the very man he should select\n",
      "for his watchman; freely giving his whole life into such an otherwise\n",
      "distrusted person’s hands.\n",

      "incommodiously close round the manned mast-heads of whalemen in these\n",
      "latitudes; one of these birds came wheeling and screaming round his\n",
      "head in a maze of untrackably swift circlings. Then it darted a\n",
      "thousand feet straight up into the air; then spiralized downwards, and\n",
      "went eddying again round his head.\n",
      "\n",
      "But with his gaze fixed upon the dim and distant horizon, Ahab seemed\n",
      "not to mark this wild bird; nor, indeed, would any one else have marked\n",
      "it much, it being no uncommon circumstance; only now almost the least\n",

      "them.\n",

      "it, and thereupon Tanaquil, his wife, declared that Tarquin would be\n",
      "king of Rome. But only by the replacing of the cap was that omen\n",
      "accounted good. Ahab’s hat was never restored; the wild hawk flew on\n",

      "still more smooth; seemed drawing a carpet over its waves; seemed a\n",
      "noon-meadow, so serenely it spread. At length the breathless hunter\n",
      "came so nigh his seemingly unsuspecting prey, that his entire dazzling\n",
      "hump was distinctly visible, sliding along the sea as if an isolated\n",
      "thing, and continually set in a revolving ring of finest, fleecy,\n",
      "greenish foam. He saw the vast, involved wrinkles of the slightly\n",
      "projecting head beyond. Before it, far out on the soft Turkish-rugged\n",
      "waters, went the glistening white shadow from his broad, milky\n",
      "forehead, a musical rippling playfully accompanying the shade; and\n",
      "behind, the blue waters interchangeably flowed over into the moving\n",
      "valley of his steady wake; and on either hand bright bubbles arose and\n",
      "danced by his side. But these were broken again by the light toes of\n",
      "hundreds of gay fowl softly feathering the sea, alternate with their\n",
      "fitful flight; and like to some flag-staff rising from the painted hull\n",
      "of an argosy, the tall but shattered pole of a recent lance projected\n",
      "from the white whale’s back; and at intervals one of the cloud of\n",
      "soft-toed fowls hovering, and to and fro skimming like a canopy over\n",
      "the fish, silently perched and rocked on this pole, the long tail\n",
      "feathers streaming like pennons.\n",
      "\n",
      "A gentle joyousness—a mighty mildness of repose in swiftness, invested\n",
      "the gliding whale. Not the white bull Jupiter swimming away with\n",
      "ravished Europa clinging to his graceful horns; his lovely, leering\n",
      "eyes sideways intent upon the maid; with smooth bewitching fleetness,\n",
      "rippling straight for the nuptial bower in Crete; not Jove, not that\n",
      "great majesty Supreme! did surpass the glorified White Whale as he so\n",
      "divinely swam.\n",
      "\n",
      "On each soft side—coincident with the parted swell, that but once\n",
      "leaving him, then flowed so wide away—on each bright side, the whale\n",
      "shed off enticings. No wonder there had been some among the hunters who\n",
      "namelessly transported and allured by all this serenity, had ventured\n",
      "to assail it; but had fatally found that quietude but the vesture of\n",
      "tornadoes. Yet calm, enticing calm, oh, whale! thou glidest on, to all\n",
      "who for the first time eye thee, no matter how many in that same way\n",

      "And thus, through the serene tranquillities of the tropical sea, among\n",
      "waves whose hand-clappings were suspended by exceeding rapture, Moby\n",
      "Dick moved on, still withholding from sight the full terrors of his\n",
      "submerged trunk, entirely hiding the wrenched hideousness of his jaw.\n",
      "But soon the fore part of him slowly rose from the water; for an\n",
      "instant his whole marbleized body formed a high arch, like Virginia’s\n",
      "Natural Bridge, and warningly waving his bannered flukes in the air,\n",
      "the grand god revealed himself, sounded, and went out of sight.\n",
      "Hoveringly halting, and dipping on the wing, the white sea-fowls\n",
      "longingly lingered over the agitated pool that he left.\n",
      "\n",
      "With oars apeak, and paddles down, the sheets of their sails adrift,\n",
      "the three boats now stilly floated, awaiting Moby Dick’s reappearance.\n",
      "\n",
      "“An hour,” said Ahab, standing rooted in his boat’s stern; and he gazed\n",
      "beyond the whale’s place, towards the dim blue spaces and wide wooing\n",
      "vacancies to leeward. It was only an instant; for again his eyes seemed\n",
      "whirling round in his head as he swept the watery circle. The breeze\n",
      "now freshened; the sea began to swell.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The birds!—the birds!” cried Tashtego.\n",
      "\n",
      "In long Indian file, as when herons take wing, the white birds were now\n",
      "all flying towards Ahab’s boat; and when within a few yards began\n",
      "fluttering over the water there, wheeling round and round, with joyous,\n",
      "expectant cries. Their vision was keener than man’s; Ahab could\n",
      "discover no sign in the sea. But suddenly as he peered down and down\n",
      "into its depths, he profoundly saw a white living spot no bigger than a\n",
      "white weasel, with wonderful celerity uprising, and magnifying as it\n",
      "rose, till it turned, and then there were plainly revealed two long\n",
      "crooked rows of white, glistening teeth, floating up from the\n",
      "undiscoverable bottom. It was Moby Dick’s open mouth and scrolled jaw;\n",
      "his vast, shadowed bulk still half blending with the blue of the sea.\n",
      "The glittering mouth yawned beneath the boat like an open-doored marble\n",
      "tomb; and giving one sidelong sweep with his steering oar, Ahab whirled\n",
      "the craft aside from this tremendous apparition. Then, calling upon\n",
      "Fedallah to change places with him, went forward to the bows, and\n",
      "seizing Perth’s harpoon, commanded his crew to grasp their oars and\n",
      "stand by to stern.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, by reason of this timely spinning round the boat upon its axis,\n",
      "its bow, by anticipation, was made to face the whale’s head while yet\n",
      "under water. But as if perceiving this stratagem, Moby Dick, with that\n",
      "malicious intelligence ascribed to him, sidelingly transplanted\n",
      "himself, as it were, in an instant, shooting his pleated head\n",
      "lengthwise beneath the boat.\n",
      "\n",
      "Through and through; through every plank and each rib, it thrilled for\n",
      "an instant, the whale obliquely lying on his back, in the manner of a\n",
      "biting shark, slowly and feelingly taking its bows full within his\n",
      "mouth, so that the long, narrow, scrolled lower jaw curled high up into\n",
      "the open air, and one of the teeth caught in a row-lock. The bluish\n",
      "pearl-white of the inside of the jaw was within six inches of Ahab’s\n",
      "head, and reached higher than that. In this attitude the White Whale\n",
      "now shook the slight cedar as a mildly cruel cat her mouse. With\n",
      "unastonished eyes Fedallah gazed, and crossed his arms; but the\n",
      "tiger-yellow crew were tumbling over each other’s heads to gain the\n",
      "uttermost stern.\n",
      "\n",
      "And now, while both elastic gunwales were springing in and out, as the\n",
      "whale dallied with the doomed craft in this devilish way; and from his\n",
      "body being submerged beneath the boat, he could not be darted at from\n",
      "the bows, for the bows were almost inside of him, as it were; and while\n",
      "the other boats involuntarily paused, as before a quick crisis\n",
      "impossible to withstand, then it was that monomaniac Ahab, furious with\n",
      "this tantalizing vicinity of his foe, which placed him all alive and\n",
      "helpless in the very jaws he hated; frenzied with all this, he seized\n",
      "the long bone with his naked hands, and wildly strove to wrench it from\n",
      "its gripe. As now he thus vainly strove, the jaw slipped from him; the\n",
      "frail gunwales bent in, collapsed, and snapped, as both jaws, like an\n",
      "enormous shears, sliding further aft, bit the craft completely in\n",
      "twain, and locked themselves fast again in the sea, midway between the\n",
      "two floating wrecks. These floated aside, the broken ends drooping, the\n",
      "crew at the stern-wreck clinging to the gunwales, and striving to hold\n",
      "fast to the oars to lash them across.\n",
      "\n",
      "At that preluding moment, ere the boat was yet snapped, Ahab, the first\n",
      "to perceive the whale’s intent, by the crafty upraising of his head, a\n",
      "movement that loosed his hold for the time; at that moment his hand had\n",
      "made one final effort to push the boat out of the bite. But only\n",
      "slipping further into the whale’s mouth, and tilting over sideways as\n",
      "it slipped, the boat had shaken off his hold on the jaw; spilled him\n",
      "out of it, as he leaned to the push; and so he fell flat-faced upon the\n",
      "sea.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ripplingly withdrawing from his prey, Moby Dick now lay at a little\n",
      "distance, vertically thrusting his oblong white head up and down in the\n",
      "billows; and at the same time slowly revolving his whole spindled body;\n",
      "so that when his vast wrinkled forehead rose—some twenty or more feet\n",
      "out of the water—the now rising swells, with all their confluent waves,\n",
      "dazzlingly broke against it; vindictively tossing their shivered spray\n",
      "still higher into the air.* So, in a gale, the but half baffled Channel\n",
      "billows only recoil from the base of the Eddystone, triumphantly to\n",
      "overleap its summit with their scud.\n",
      "\n",
      "*This motion is peculiar to the sperm whale. It receives its\n",
      "designation (pitchpoling) from its being likened to that preliminary\n",
      "up-and-down poise of the whale-lance, in the exercise called\n",
      "pitchpoling, previously described. By this motion the whale must best\n",
      "and most comprehensively view whatever objects may be encircling him.\n",
      "\n",
      "But soon resuming his horizontal attitude, Moby Dick swam swiftly round\n",
      "and round the wrecked crew; sideways churning the water in his vengeful\n",
      "wake, as if lashing himself up to still another and more deadly\n",
      "assault. The sight of the splintered boat seemed to madden him, as the\n",
      "blood of grapes and mulberries cast before Antiochus’s elephants in the\n",
      "book of Maccabees. Meanwhile Ahab half smothered in the foam of the\n",
      "whale’s insolent tail, and too much of a cripple to swim,—though he\n",
      "could still keep afloat, even in the heart of such a whirlpool as that;\n",
      "helpless Ahab’s head was seen, like a tossed bubble which the least\n",
      "chance shock might burst. From the boat’s fragmentary stern, Fedallah\n",
      "incuriously and mildly eyed him; the clinging crew, at the other\n",
      "drifting end, could not succor him; more than enough was it for them to\n",
      "look to themselves. For so revolvingly appalling was the White Whale’s\n",
      "aspect, and so planetarily swift the ever-contracting circles he made,\n",
      "that he seemed horizontally swooping upon them. And though the other\n",
      "boats, unharmed, still hovered hard by; still they dared not pull into\n",
      "the eddy to strike, lest that should be the signal for the instant\n",
      "destruction of the jeopardized castaways, Ahab and all; nor in that\n",
      "case could they themselves hope to escape. With straining eyes, then,\n",
      "they remained on the outer edge of the direful zone, whose centre had\n",
      "now become the old man’s head.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meantime, from the beginning all this had been descried from the ship’s\n",
      "mast heads; and squaring her yards, she had borne down upon the scene;\n",
      "and was now so nigh, that Ahab in the water hailed her!—“Sail on\n",
      "the”—but that moment a breaking sea dashed on him from Moby Dick, and\n",
      "whelmed him for the time. But struggling out of it again, and chancing\n",
      "to rise on a towering crest, he shouted,—“Sail on the whale!—Drive him\n",
      "off!”\n",
      "\n",
      "The Pequod’s prows were pointed; and breaking up the charmed circle,\n",
      "she effectually parted the white whale from his victim. As he sullenly\n",
      "swam off, the boats flew to the rescue.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dragged into Stubb’s boat with blood-shot, blinded eyes, the white\n",
      "brine caking in his wrinkles; the long tension of Ahab’s bodily\n",
      "strength did crack, and helplessly he yielded to his body’s doom: for a\n",
      "time, lying all crushed in the bottom of Stubb’s boat, like one trodden\n",
      "under foot of herds of elephants. Far inland, nameless wails came from\n",
      "him, as desolate sounds from out ravines.\n",
      "\n",
      "But this intensity of his physical prostration did but so much the more\n",
      "abbreviate it. In an instant’s compass, great hearts sometimes condense\n",
      "to one deep pang, the sum total of those shallow pains kindly diffused\n",
      "through feebler men’s whole lives. And so, such hearts, though summary\n",
      "in each one suffering; still, if the gods decree it, in their life-time\n",
      "aggregate a whole age of woe, wholly made up of instantaneous\n",
      "intensities; for even in their pointless centres, those noble natures\n",
      "contain the entire circumferences of inferior souls.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The harpoon,” said Ahab, half way rising, and draggingly leaning on\n",
      "one bended arm—“is it safe?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Aye, sir, for it was not darted; this is it,” said Stubb, showing it.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Lay it before me;—any missing men?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“One, two, three, four, five;—there were five oars, sir, and here are\n",
      "five men.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“That’s good.—Help me, man; I wish to stand. So, so, I see him! there!\n",
      "there! going to leeward still; what a leaping spout!—Hands off from me!\n",
      "The eternal sap runs up in Ahab’s bones again! Set the sail; out oars;\n",
      "the helm!”\n",
      "\n",
      "It is often the case that when a boat is stove, its crew, being picked\n",
      "up by another boat, help to work that second boat; and the chase is\n",
      "thus continued with what is called double-banked oars. It was thus now.\n",
      "But the added power of the boat did not equal the added power of the\n",
      "whale, for he seemed to have treble-banked his every fin; swimming with\n",
      "a velocity which plainly showed, that if now, under these\n",
      "circumstances, pushed on, the chase would prove an indefinitely\n",
      "prolonged, if not a hopeless one; nor could any crew endure for so long\n",
      "a period, such an unintermitted, intense straining at the oar; a thing\n",
      "barely tolerable only in some one brief vicissitude. The ship itself,\n",
      "then, as it sometimes happens, offered the most promising intermediate\n",
      "means of overtaking the chase. Accordingly, the boats now made for her,\n",
      "and were soon swayed up to their cranes—the two parts of the wrecked\n",
      "boat having been previously secured by her—and then hoisting everything\n",
      "to her side, and stacking her canvas high up, and sideways\n",
      "outstretching it with stun-sails, like the double-jointed wings of an\n",
      "albatross; the Pequod bore down in the leeward wake of Moby-Dick. At\n",
      "the well known, methodic intervals, the whale’s glittering spout was\n",
      "regularly announced from the manned mast-heads; and when he would be\n",
      "reported as just gone down, Ahab would take the time, and then pacing\n",
      "the deck, binnacle-watch in hand, so soon as the last second of the\n",
      "allotted hour expired, his voice was heard.—“Whose is the doubloon now?\n",
      "D’ye see him?” and if the reply was, No, sir! straightway he commanded\n",
      "them to lift him to his perch. In this way the day wore on; Ahab, now\n",
      "aloft and motionless; anon, unrestingly pacing the planks.\n",
      "\n",
      "As he was thus walking, uttering no sound, except to hail the men\n",
      "aloft, or to bid them hoist a sail still higher, or to spread one to a\n",
      "still greater breadth—thus to and fro pacing, beneath his slouched hat,\n",
      "at every turn he passed his own wrecked boat, which had been dropped\n",
      "upon the quarter-deck, and lay there reversed; broken bow to shattered\n",
      "stern. At last he paused before it; and as in an already over-clouded\n",
      "sky fresh troops of clouds will sometimes sail across, so over the old\n",
      "man’s face there now stole some such added gloom as this.\n",
      "\n",
      "Stubb saw him pause; and perhaps intending, not vainly, though, to\n",
      "evince his own unabated fortitude, and thus keep up a valiant place in\n",
      "his Captain’s mind, he advanced, and eyeing the wreck exclaimed—“The\n",

      "Soon, it was almost dark, but the look-out men still remained unset.\n",

      "a fresh hand to the fore-mast head, and see it manned till\n",

      "The ship tore on; leaving such a furrow in the sea as when a\n",
      "cannon-ball, missent, becomes a plough-share and turns up the level\n",
      "field.\n",
      "\n",
      "“By salt and hemp!” cried Stubb, “but this swift motion of the deck\n",
      "creeps up one’s legs and tingles at the heart. This ship and I are two\n",
      "brave fellows!—Ha, ha! Some one take me up, and launch me, spine-wise,\n",
      "on the sea,—for by live-oaks! my spine’s a keel. Ha, ha! we go the gait\n",
      "that leaves no dust behind!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“There she blows—she blows!—she blows!—right ahead!” was now the\n",
      "mast-head cry.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Aye, aye!” cried Stubb, “I knew it—ye can’t escape—blow on and split\n",
      "your spout, O whale! the mad fiend himself is after ye! blow your\n",
      "trump—blister your lungs!—Ahab will dam off your blood, as a miller\n",
      "shuts his watergate upon the stream!”\n",
      "\n",
      "And Stubb did but speak out for well nigh all that crew. The frenzies\n",
      "of the chase had by this time worked them bubblingly up, like old wine\n",
      "worked anew. Whatever pale fears and forebodings some of them might\n",
      "have felt before; these were not only now kept out of sight through the\n",
      "growing awe of Ahab, but they were broken up, and on all sides routed,\n",
      "as timid prairie hares that scatter before the bounding bison. The hand\n",
      "of Fate had snatched all their souls; and by the stirring perils of the\n",
      "previous day; the rack of the past night’s suspense; the fixed,\n",
      "unfearing, blind, reckless way in which their wild craft went plunging\n",
      "towards its flying mark; by all these things, their hearts were bowled\n",
      "along. The wind that made great bellies of their sails, and rushed the\n",
      "vessel on by arms invisible as irresistible; this seemed the symbol of\n",
      "that unseen agency which so enslaved them to the race.\n",
      "\n",
      "They were one man, not thirty. For as the one ship that held them all;\n",
      "though it was put together of all contrasting things—oak, and maple,\n",
      "and pine wood; iron, and pitch, and hemp—yet all these ran into each\n",
      "other in the one concrete hull, which shot on its way, both balanced\n",
      "and directed by the long central keel; even so, all the individualities\n",
      "of the crew, this man’s valor, that man’s fear; guilt and guiltiness,\n",
      "all varieties were welded into oneness, and were all directed to that\n",
      "fatal goal which Ahab their one lord and keel did point to.\n",
      "\n",
      "The rigging lived. The mast-heads, like the tops of tall palms, were\n",
      "outspreadingly tufted with arms and legs. Clinging to a spar with one\n",
      "hand, some reached forth the other with impatient wavings; others,\n",
      "shading their eyes from the vivid sunlight, sat far out on the rocking\n",
      "yards; all the spars in full bearing of mortals, ready and ripe for\n",
      "their fate. Ah! how they still strove through that infinite blueness to\n",
      "seek out the thing that might destroy them!\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why sing ye not out for him, if ye see him?” cried Ahab, when, after\n",
      "the lapse of some minutes since the first cry, no more had been heard.\n",
      "“Sway me up, men; ye have been deceived; not Moby Dick casts one odd\n",
      "jet that way, and then disappears.”\n",
      "\n",
      "It was even so; in their headlong eagerness, the men had mistaken some\n",
      "other thing for the whale-spout, as the event itself soon proved; for\n",
      "hardly had Ahab reached his perch; hardly was the rope belayed to its\n",
      "pin on deck, when he struck the key-note to an orchestra, that made the\n",
      "air vibrate as with the combined discharges of rifles. The triumphant\n",
      "halloo of thirty buckskin lungs was heard, as—much nearer to the ship\n",
      "than the place of the imaginary jet, less than a mile ahead—Moby Dick\n",
      "bodily burst into view! For not by any calm and indolent spoutings; not\n",
      "by the peaceable gush of that mystic fountain in his head, did the\n",
      "White Whale now reveal his vicinity; but by the far more wondrous\n",
      "phenomenon of breaching. Rising with his utmost velocity from the\n",
      "furthest depths, the Sperm Whale thus booms his entire bulk into the\n",
      "pure element of air, and piling up a mountain of dazzling foam, shows\n",
      "his place to the distance of seven miles and more. In those moments,\n",
      "the torn, enraged waves he shakes off, seem his mane; in some cases,\n",
      "this breaching is his act of defiance.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There she breaches! there she breaches!” was the cry, as in his\n",
      "immeasurable bravadoes the White Whale tossed himself salmon-like to\n",
      "Heaven. So suddenly seen in the blue plain of the sea, and relieved\n",
      "against the still bluer margin of the sky, the spray that he raised,\n",
      "for the moment, intolerably glittered and glared like a glacier; and\n",
      "stood there gradually fading and fading away from its first sparkling\n",
      "intensity, to the dim mistiness of an advancing shower in a vale.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Aye, breach your last to the sun, Moby Dick!” cried Ahab, “thy hour\n",
      "and thy harpoon are at hand!—Down! down all of ye, but one man at the\n",
      "fore. The boats!—stand by!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Unmindful of the tedious rope-ladders of the shrouds, the men, like\n",
      "shooting stars, slid to the deck, by the isolated backstays and\n",
      "halyards; while Ahab, less dartingly, but still rapidly was dropped\n",
      "from his perch.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Lower away,” he cried, so soon as he had reached his boat—a spare one,\n",
      "rigged the afternoon previous. “Mr. Starbuck, the ship is thine—keep\n",
      "away from the boats, but keep near them. Lower, all!”\n",
      "\n",
      "As if to strike a quick terror into them, by this time being the first\n",
      "assailant himself, Moby Dick had turned, and was now coming for the\n",
      "three crews. Ahab’s boat was central; and cheering his men, he told\n",
      "them he would take the whale head-and-head,—that is, pull straight up\n",
      "to his forehead,—a not uncommon thing; for when within a certain limit,\n",
      "such a course excludes the coming onset from the whale’s sidelong\n",
      "vision. But ere that close limit was gained, and while yet all three\n",
      "boats were plain as the ship’s three masts to his eye; the White Whale\n",
      "churning himself into furious speed, almost in an instant as it were,\n",
      "rushing among the boats with open jaws, and a lashing tail, offered\n",
      "appalling battle on every side; and heedless of the irons darted at him\n",
      "from every boat, seemed only intent on annihilating each separate plank\n",
      "of which those boats were made. But skilfully manœuvred, incessantly\n",
      "wheeling like trained chargers in the field; the boats for a while\n",
      "eluded him; though, at times, but by a plank’s breadth; while all the\n",
      "time, Ahab’s unearthly slogan tore every other cry but his to shreds.\n",
      "\n",
      "But at last in his untraceable evolutions, the White Whale so crossed\n",
      "and recrossed, and in a thousand ways entangled the slack of the three\n",
      "lines now fast to him, that they foreshortened, and, of themselves,\n",
      "warped the devoted boats towards the planted irons in him; though now\n",
      "for a moment the whale drew aside a little, as if to rally for a more\n",
      "tremendous charge. Seizing that opportunity, Ahab first paid out more\n",
      "line: and then was rapidly hauling and jerking in upon it again—hoping\n",
      "that way to disencumber it of some snarls—when lo!—a sight more savage\n",
      "than the embattled teeth of sharks!\n",
      "\n",
      "Caught and twisted—corkscrewed in the mazes of the line, loose harpoons\n",
      "and lances, with all their bristling barbs and points, came flashing\n",
      "and dripping up to the chocks in the bows of Ahab’s boat. Only one\n",
      "thing could be done. Seizing the boat-knife, he critically reached\n",
      "within—through—and then, without—the rays of steel; dragged in the line\n",
      "beyond, passed it, inboard, to the bowsman, and then, twice sundering\n",
      "the rope near the chocks—dropped the intercepted fagot of steel into\n",
      "the sea; and was all fast again. That instant, the White Whale made a\n",
      "sudden rush among the remaining tangles of the other lines; by so\n",
      "doing, irresistibly dragged the more involved boats of Stubb and Flask\n",
      "towards his flukes; dashed them together like two rolling husks on a\n",
      "surf-beaten beach, and then, diving down into the sea, disappeared in a\n",
      "boiling maelstrom, in which, for a space, the odorous cedar chips of\n",
      "the wrecks danced round and round, like the grated nutmeg in a swiftly\n",
      "stirred bowl of punch.\n",
      "\n",
      "While the two crews were yet circling in the waters, reaching out after\n",
      "the revolving line-tubs, oars, and other floating furniture, while\n",
      "aslope little Flask bobbed up and down like an empty vial, twitching\n",
      "his legs upwards to escape the dreaded jaws of sharks; and Stubb was\n",
      "lustily singing out for some one to ladle him up; and while the old\n",
      "man’s line—now parting—admitted of his pulling into the creamy pool to\n",
      "rescue whom he could;—in that wild simultaneousness of a thousand\n",
      "concreted perils,—Ahab’s yet unstricken boat seemed drawn up towards\n",
      "Heaven by invisible wires,—as, arrow-like, shooting perpendicularly\n",
      "from the sea, the White Whale dashed his broad forehead against its\n",
      "bottom, and sent it, turning over and over, into the air; till it fell\n",
      "again—gunwale downwards—and Ahab and his men struggled out from under\n",
      "it, like seals from a sea-side cave.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first uprising momentum of the whale—modifying its direction as he\n",
      "struck the surface—involuntarily launched him along it, to a little\n",
      "distance from the centre of the destruction he had made; and with his\n",
      "back to it, he now lay for a moment slowly feeling with his flukes from\n",
      "side to side; and whenever a stray oar, bit of plank, the least chip or\n",
      "crumb of the boats touched his skin, his tail swiftly drew back, and\n",
      "came sideways smiting the sea. But soon, as if satisfied that his work\n",
      "for that time was done, he pushed his pleated forehead through the\n",
      "ocean, and trailing after him the intertangled lines, continued his\n",
      "leeward way at a traveller’s methodic pace.\n",
      "\n",
      "As before, the attentive ship having descried the whole fight, again\n",
      "came bearing down to the rescue, and dropping a boat, picked up the\n",
      "floating mariners, tubs, oars, and whatever else could be caught at,\n",
      "and safely landed them on her decks. Some sprained shoulders, wrists,\n",
      "and ankles; livid contusions; wrenched harpoons and lances;\n",
      "inextricable intricacies of rope; shattered oars and planks; all these\n",
      "were there; but no fatal or even serious ill seemed to have befallen\n",
      "any one. As with Fedallah the day before, so Ahab was now found grimly\n",
      "clinging to his boat’s broken half, which afforded a comparatively easy\n",
      "float; nor did it so exhaust him as the previous day’s mishap.\n",
      "\n",
      "But when he was helped to the deck, all eyes were fastened upon him; as\n",
      "instead of standing by himself he still half-hung upon the shoulder of\n",
      "Starbuck, who had thus far been the foremost to assist him. His ivory\n",
      "leg had been snapped off, leaving but one short sharp splinter.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Aye, aye, Starbuck, ’tis sweet to lean sometimes, be the leaner who he\n",
      "will; and would old Ahab had leaned oftener than he has.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“The ferrule has not stood, sir,” said the carpenter, now coming up; “I\n",
      "put good work into that leg.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But no bones broken, sir, I hope,” said Stubb with true concern.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Aye! and all splintered to pieces, Stubb!—d’ye see it.—But even with a\n",
      "broken bone, old Ahab is untouched; and I account no living bone of\n",
      "mine one jot more me, than this dead one that’s lost. Nor white whale,\n",
      "nor man, nor fiend, can so much as graze old Ahab in his own proper and\n",
      "inaccessible being. Can any lead touch yonder floor, any mast scrape\n",
      "yonder roof?—Aloft there! which way?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Dead to leeward, sir.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Up helm, then; pile on the sail again, ship keepers! down the rest of\n",
      "the spare boats and rig them—Mr. Starbuck away, and muster the boat’s\n",
      "crews.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Let me first help thee towards the bulwarks, sir.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, oh, oh! how this splinter gores me now! Accursed fate! that the\n",
      "unconquerable captain in the soul should have such a craven mate!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Sir?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“My body, man, not thee. Give me something for a cane—there, that\n",

      "By heaven it cannot be!—missing?—quick! call them all.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The old man’s hinted thought was true. Upon mustering the company, the\n",
      "Parsee was not there.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The Parsee!” cried Stubb—“he must have been caught in——”\n",
      "\n",
      "“The black vomit wrench thee!—run all of ye above, alow, cabin,\n",
      "forecastle—find him—not gone—not gone!”\n",

      "nowhere to be found.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Aye, sir,” said Stubb—“caught among the tangles of your line—I thought\n",

      "\n",
      "“_My_ line! _my_ line? Gone?—gone? What means that little word?—What\n",

      "\n",
      "“Great God! but for one single instant show thyself,” cried Starbuck;\n",
      "“never, never wilt thou capture him, old man—In Jesus’ name no more of\n",
      "this, that’s worse than devil’s madness. Two days chased; twice stove\n",

      "matter of the whale, be the front of thy face to me as the palm of this\n",
      "hand—a lipless, unfeatured blank. Ahab is for ever Ahab, man. This\n",
      "whole act’s immutably decreed. ’Twas rehearsed by thee and me a billion\n",

      "lance; propped up on a lonely foot. ’Tis Ahab—his body’s part; but\n",
      "Ahab’s soul’s a centipede, that moves upon a hundred legs. I feel\n",
      "strained, half stranded, as ropes that tow dismasted frigates in a\n",

      "he’s chasing _me_ now; not I, _him_—that’s bad; I might have known it,\n",
      "too. Fool! the lines—the harpoons he’s towing. Aye, aye, I have run him\n",
      "by last night. About! about! Come down, all of ye, but the regular look\n",
      "outs! Man the braces!”\n",

      "Steering as she had done, the wind had been somewhat on the Pequod’s\n",

      "made of dead trees outlast the lives of men made of the most vital\n",
      "stuff of vital fathers. What’s that he said? he should still go before\n",
      "me, my pilot; and yet to be seen again? But where? Will I have eyes at\n",
      "the bottom of the sea, supposing I descend those endless stairs? and\n",
      "all night I’ve been sailing from him, wherever he did sink to. Aye,\n",

      "\n",
      "But Ahab heard nothing; for his own voice was high-lifted then; and the\n",
      "boat leaped on.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet the voice spake true; for scarce had he pushed from the ship, when\n",
      "numbers of sharks, seemingly rising from out the dark waters beneath\n",
      "the hull, maliciously snapped at the blades of the oars, every time\n",
      "they dipped in the water; and in this way accompanied the boat with\n",
      "their bites. It is a thing not uncommonly happening to the whale-boats\n",
      "in those swarming seas; the sharks at times apparently following them\n",
      "in the same prescient way that vultures hover over the banners of\n",
      "marching regiments in the east. But these were the first sharks that\n",
      "had been observed by the Pequod since the White Whale had been first\n",
      "descried; and whether it was that Ahab’s crew were all such\n",
      "tiger-yellow barbarians, and therefore their flesh more musky to the\n",
      "senses of the sharks—a matter sometimes well known to affect\n",
      "them,—however it was, they seemed to follow that one boat without\n",
      "molesting the others.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Heart of wrought steel!” murmured Starbuck gazing over the side, and\n",
      "following with his eyes the receding boat—“canst thou yet ring boldly\n",
      "to that sight?—lowering thy keel among ravening sharks, and followed by\n",
      "them, open-mouthed to the chase; and this the critical third day?—For\n",
      "when three days flow together in one continuous intense pursuit; be\n",
      "sure the first is the morning, the second the noon, and the third the\n",
      "evening and the end of that thing—be that end what it may. Oh! my God!\n",
      "what is this that shoots through me, and leaves me so deadly calm, yet\n",
      "expectant,—fixed at the top of a shudder! Future things swim before me,\n",
      "as in empty outlines and skeletons; all the past is somehow grown dim.\n",
      "Mary, girl! thou fadest in pale glories behind me; boy! I seem to see\n",
      "but thy eyes grown wondrous blue. Strangest problems of life seem\n",
      "clearing; but clouds sweep between—Is my journey’s end coming? My legs\n",
      "feel faint; like his who has footed it all day. Feel thy heart,—beats\n",
      "it yet? Stir thyself, Starbuck!—stave it off—move, move! speak\n",
      "aloud!—Mast-head there! See ye my boy’s hand on the hill?—Crazed;—aloft\n",
      "there!—keep thy keenest eye upon the boats:—mark well the whale!—Ho!\n",
      "again!—drive off that hawk! see! he pecks—he tears the vane”—pointing\n",
      "to the red flag flying at the main-truck—“Ha! he soars away with\n",

      "shudder!”\n",
      "\n",
      "The boats had not gone very far, when by a signal from the mast-heads—a\n",
      "downward pointed arm, Ahab knew that the whale had sounded; but\n",
      "intending to be near him at the next rising, he held on his way a\n",
      "little sideways from the vessel; the becharmed crew maintaining the\n",
      "profoundest silence, as the head-beat waves hammered and hammered\n",
      "against the opposing bow.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Drive, drive in your nails, oh ye waves! to their uttermost heads\n",
      "drive them in! ye but strike a thing without a lid; and no coffin and\n",
      "no hearse can be mine:—and hemp only can kill me! Ha! ha!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Suddenly the waters around them slowly swelled in broad circles; then\n",
      "quickly upheaved, as if sideways sliding from a submerged berg of ice,\n",
      "swiftly rising to the surface. A low rumbling sound was heard; a\n",
      "subterraneous hum; and then all held their breaths; as bedraggled with\n",
      "trailing ropes, and harpoons, and lances, a vast form shot lengthwise,\n",
      "but obliquely from the sea. Shrouded in a thin drooping veil of mist,\n",
      "it hovered for a moment in the rainbowed air; and then fell swamping\n",
      "back into the deep. Crushed thirty feet upwards, the waters flashed for\n",
      "an instant like heaps of fountains, then brokenly sank in a shower of\n",
      "flakes, leaving the circling surface creamed like new milk round the\n",
      "marble trunk of the whale.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Give way!” cried Ahab to the oarsmen, and the boats darted forward to\n",
      "the attack; but maddened by yesterday’s fresh irons that corroded in\n",
      "him, Moby Dick seemed combinedly possessed by all the angels that fell\n",
      "from heaven. The wide tiers of welded tendons overspreading his broad\n",
      "white forehead, beneath the transparent skin, looked knitted together;\n",
      "as head on, he came churning his tail among the boats; and once more\n",
      "flailed them apart; spilling out the irons and lances from the two\n",
      "mates’ boats, and dashing in one side of the upper part of their bows,\n",
      "but leaving Ahab’s almost without a scar.\n",
      "\n",
      "While Daggoo and Queequeg were stopping the strained planks; and as the\n",
      "whale swimming out from them, turned, and showed one entire flank as he\n",
      "shot by them again; at that moment a quick cry went up. Lashed round\n",
      "and round to the fish’s back; pinioned in the turns upon turns in\n",
      "which, during the past night, the whale had reeled the involutions of\n",
      "the lines around him, the half torn body of the Parsee was seen; his\n",
      "sable raiment frayed to shreds; his distended eyes turned full upon old\n",
      "Ahab.\n",
      "\n",
      "The harpoon dropped from his hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Befooled, befooled!”—drawing in a long lean breath—“Aye, Parsee! I see\n",
      "thee again.—Aye, and thou goest before; and this, _this_ then is the\n",
      "hearse that thou didst promise. But I hold thee to the last letter of\n",
      "thy word. Where is the second hearse? Away, mates, to the ship! those\n",
      "boats are useless now; repair them if ye can in time, and return to me;\n",
      "if not, Ahab is enough to die—Down, men! the first thing that but\n",
      "offers to jump from this boat I stand in, that thing I harpoon. Ye are\n",
      "not other men, but my arms and my legs; and so obey me.—Where’s the\n",
      "whale? gone down again?”\n",
      "\n",
      "But he looked too nigh the boat; for as if bent upon escaping with the\n",
      "corpse he bore, and as if the particular place of the last encounter\n",
      "had been but a stage in his leeward voyage, Moby Dick was now again\n",
      "steadily swimming forward; and had almost passed the ship,—which thus\n",
      "far had been sailing in the contrary direction to him, though for the\n",
      "present her headway had been stopped. He seemed swimming with his\n",
      "utmost velocity, and now only intent upon pursuing his own straight\n",
      "path in the sea.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh! Ahab,” cried Starbuck, “not too late is it, even now, the third\n",
      "day, to desist. See! Moby Dick seeks thee not. It is thou, thou, that\n",
      "madly seekest him!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Setting sail to the rising wind, the lonely boat was swiftly impelled\n",
      "to leeward, by both oars and canvas. And at last when Ahab was sliding\n",
      "by the vessel, so near as plainly to distinguish Starbuck’s face as he\n",
      "leaned over the rail, he hailed him to turn the vessel about, and\n",
      "follow him, not too swiftly, at a judicious interval. Glancing upwards,\n",
      "he saw Tashtego, Queequeg, and Daggoo, eagerly mounting to the three\n",
      "mast-heads; while the oarsmen were rocking in the two staved boats\n",
      "which had but just been hoisted to the side, and were busily at work in\n",
      "repairing them. One after the other, through the port-holes, as he\n",
      "sped, he also caught flying glimpses of Stubb and Flask, busying\n",
      "themselves on deck among bundles of new irons and lances. As he saw all\n",
      "this; as he heard the hammers in the broken boats; far other hammers\n",
      "seemed driving a nail into his heart. But he rallied. And now marking\n",
      "that the vane or flag was gone from the main-mast-head, he shouted to\n",
      "Tashtego, who had just gained that perch, to descend again for another\n",
      "flag, and a hammer and nails, and so nail it to the mast.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whether fagged by the three days’ running chase, and the resistance to\n",
      "his swimming in the knotted hamper he bore; or whether it was some\n",
      "latent deceitfulness and malice in him: whichever was true, the White\n",
      "Whale’s way now began to abate, as it seemed, from the boat so rapidly\n",
      "nearing him once more; though indeed the whale’s last start had not\n",
      "been so long a one as before. And still as Ahab glided over the waves\n",
      "the unpitying sharks accompanied him; and so pertinaciously stuck to\n",
      "the boat; and so continually bit at the plying oars, that the blades\n",
      "became jagged and crunched, and left small splinters in the sea, at\n",
      "almost every dip.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Heed them not! those teeth but give new rowlocks to your oars. Pull\n",
      "on! ’tis the better rest, the shark’s jaw than the yielding water.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But at every bite, sir, the thin blades grow smaller and smaller!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“They will last long enough! pull on!—But who can tell”—he\n",
      "muttered—“whether these sharks swim to feast on the whale or on\n",
      "Ahab?—But pull on! Aye, all alive, now—we near him. The helm! take the\n",
      "helm! let me pass,”—and so saying two of the oarsmen helped him forward\n",
      "to the bows of the still flying boat.\n",
      "\n",
      "At length as the craft was cast to one side, and ran ranging along with\n",
      "the White Whale’s flank, he seemed strangely oblivious of its\n",
      "advance—as the whale sometimes will—and Ahab was fairly within the\n",
      "smoky mountain mist, which, thrown off from the whale’s spout, curled\n",
      "round his great, Monadnock hump; he was even thus close to him; when,\n",
      "with body arched back, and both arms lengthwise high-lifted to the\n",
      "poise, he darted his fierce iron, and his far fiercer curse into the\n",
      "hated whale. As both steel and curse sank to the socket, as if sucked\n",
      "into a morass, Moby Dick sideways writhed; spasmodically rolled his\n",
      "nigh flank against the bow, and, without staving a hole in it, so\n",
      "suddenly canted the boat over, that had it not been for the elevated\n",
      "part of the gunwale to which he then clung, Ahab would once more have\n",
      "been tossed into the sea. As it was, three of the oarsmen—who foreknew\n",
      "not the precise instant of the dart, and were therefore unprepared for\n",
      "its effects—these were flung out; but so fell, that, in an instant two\n",
      "of them clutched the gunwale again, and rising to its level on a\n",
      "combing wave, hurled themselves bodily inboard again; the third man\n",
      "helplessly dropping astern, but still afloat and swimming.\n",
      "\n",
      "Almost simultaneously, with a mighty volition of ungraduated,\n",
      "instantaneous swiftness, the White Whale darted through the weltering\n",
      "sea. But when Ahab cried out to the steersman to take new turns with\n",
      "the line, and hold it so; and commanded the crew to turn round on their\n",
      "seats, and tow the boat up to the mark; the moment the treacherous line\n",
      "felt that double strain and tug, it snapped in the empty air!\n",
      "\n",
      "“What breaks in me? Some sinew cracks!—’tis whole again; oars! oars!\n",
      "Burst in upon him!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Hearing the tremendous rush of the sea-crashing boat, the whale wheeled\n",
      "round to present his blank forehead at bay; but in that evolution,\n",
      "catching sight of the nearing black hull of the ship; seemingly seeing\n",
      "in it the source of all his persecutions; bethinking it—it may be—a\n",
      "larger and nobler foe; of a sudden, he bore down upon its advancing\n",
      "prow, smiting his jaws amid fiery showers of foam.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ahab staggered; his hand smote his forehead. “I grow blind; hands!\n",
      "stretch out before me that I may yet grope my way. Is’t night?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“The whale! The ship!” cried the cringing oarsmen.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oars! oars! Slope downwards to thy depths, O sea, that ere it be for\n",
      "ever too late, Ahab may slide this last, last time upon his mark! I\n",
      "see: the ship! the ship! Dash on, my men! Will ye not save my ship?”\n",
      "\n",
      "But as the oarsmen violently forced their boat through the\n",
      "sledge-hammering seas, the before whale-smitten bow-ends of two planks\n",
      "burst through, and in an instant almost, the temporarily disabled boat\n",
      "lay nearly level with the waves; its half-wading, splashing crew,\n",
      "trying hard to stop the gap and bale out the pouring water.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meantime, for that one beholding instant, Tashtego’s mast-head hammer\n",

      "forward-flowing heart; while Starbuck and Stubb, standing upon the\n",

      "“The whale, the whale! Up helm, up helm! Oh, all ye sweet powers of\n",
